virgin of juarez the film offers a rather unique storyline blending current sociopolitical concerns the constant flow of mexican migrant workers back and forth across the us/mexican border and the traditional catholic beliefs of the hispanic population i must say i was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfoldsvirgin of juarez is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing minnie driver delivers a solid performance and ana claudia talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary mariela also starring esai morales and angus macfadyen braveheart'], [u'b003ai2vga', u'30', u'worthwhile and important story hampered by poor script and production', u'the virgin of juarez is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of juarez mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring el paso texas  the story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and directorkarina danes minnie driver is a journalist for a los angeles newspaper who has flown to juarez to investigate the multiple in the hundreds killings of young women the targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the us sponsored sweatshops in juarez who are picked up at night after work raped beaten and killed  danes is convinced the juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies in part due to her own past issues of being too idle with similar crimes in the us  she meets father herrera esai morales and a community activist patrick angus macfadyen and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder discovering along the way a survivor named mariela ana claudia talanc&oacuten a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the virgin mary  a father of one of the victims isidro jorge cervera jr nurtures mariela and helps her to escape the hospital placing her in a church where she becomes a saint to the people of juarez who long for the crimes to end  mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims families  danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators taking a sheet of photos of most wanted men from the police office of detective lauro jacob vargas and works with the police and father herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in juarez fearing for marielas life they transport her to los angeles where mysterious events end the storythe squeaky mawkish script was written by michael fallon and directed by kevin james dobson  had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism the story would possibly have been better related  there are some good performances by driver talanc&oacuten morales and vargas but the minor roles vary in quality  reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema  it is sad when script and the production dull the impact  grady harp june 07'], [u'b003ai2vga', u'50', u'this movie needed to be made', u'the scenes in this film can be very disquieting due to their graphic reenactment of real events but this story needs to be told i will say the violence was injected into the movie with as much taste as manageable when dealing with rape scenes etc inspired by true events women are being murdered in juarez after they leave the factory where they work a fearful community is suddenly given some hope when one of the young victims not only lives but experiences stigmata after seeing the virgin mary  i was shocked to learn that murders in juarez are still happening and many are unsolved i believe this director brought a very important story to the surface though its never pleasant to think about young women being murdered this movie depicts a harsh reality of the high cost of exploitedcheap laborchrissy k

just across the border from el paso texas  it is home to several factories owned by american companies who employ mexicans at very low wages  since the early 1990s juarez has also been the murder site of hundreds of women  there is a lot of debate as to whether the deaths are the work of a drug gang or a serial killer  it has also been suggested that due to the local police departments failure to solve the crimes new rapists and thugs have moved to the area knowing that they will never be caught  the situation is an overwhelming tragedy and this movie uses the story as a backdropwe start off seeing how unsafe women feel as they walk and work in juarez  then we meet the hardheaded american journalist played by minnie driver  she aggressively questions the local police and befriends a catholic priest  within the first twenty minutes or so we see the terrifying reality of the situation in juarezat this point the story jumps from something that might have happened to something that is only found in this movie  a woman named mariela survives an brutal attack but is in critical condition in a small hospital  while the priest is speaking to her she lets out a howl and her hands begin bleeding*  this stigmata is meant to show that she has been blessed by the virgin mary  our reporter protagonist clashes with various authorities on what should be done  meanwhile mariela goes underground and attracts a devoted following eventually landing her own radio show  and living under the protection of gang members whom she refers to as modern warriors  the only thing missing is jes&uacutes malverdenow i understand that we dont know everything about the juarez murders and that a screenwriter has to fill in the blanks when crafting an exciting dramatization  however if you are going to deviate so far from the true story then dont preface your movie as being based on the ongoing unsolved murders in cuidad juarez  there is plenty of interesting and legitimate information in the real stories of juarez and there is no need to fabricate  this movie may raise the issue of the juarez women but it isnt really about them at allif you are interested in learning more about the killings in juarez there are a few documentaries  a recent one from las perlas del mar films is simply titled juarez and is a good introduction  zulma aguiars juarez mothers fight femicide focuses on

that have been absolutely flawless  this latest dvd &quotrock rhythm and &quotdoo wop&quot is a total delight to ones ears  keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era when vocal talent was essential to get a recording contract  they did not have modern day computerized overdub technology which enables many modern day artists with limited ability to survive  this dvd reads like a whos who of early rock  the architect of rock little richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of &quotkeepa rockin&quot and the lineup that follows keeps this concert at a premium level of performances  you get to see and hear lou christie little anthony and the imperials jerry butler lloyd price joey dee and the starliters frankie valli fred paris and the satins and the countours just to name a few  however nothing prepared me for the performance of jay black and the americans  after singing &quotthis magic moment&quot jay gave a performance that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again  as he prepared to sing &quotcara mia&quot he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25 and must now at age 62 hit those same notes  hit those notes he did  using that opera trained voice he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on its feet showering him with a well deserved standing ovation  if you are a fan of the oldtime vocal and

it is actually in color and very well produced  the producer in fact is just a kid only about 30 years old  but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect and truly celebrates their works the dvd also has about an hour of excellent interviews'], [u'b00006haxw', u'50', u'if you like doowop you gotta have this dvd', u'wow when i saw this show on pbsthat was it i had to have this  what

the cr&egraveme de la cr&egraveme of the 50s groups to doo wop 51 it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production better lighting better stage layout and better sound qualitysadly in terms of editing they went overboard this time excessive use of prerecorded clapping and cheering really irritated me there are times where you can hardly hear the singing because the prerecorded cheering was so loud imagine 5 stadiums hosting the super bowl all crammed into one theater its simply too artificial we want not only the authentic groups but also the authentic reaction from who was there and believe me we dont need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groupsfor whoever edited the show i would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at doo wop 51 for better camera angles of the groupsis this dvd worth buying definately because groups/singers fred parris &amp the satins little anthony &amp the imperials little richard the limelites jerry butler lloyd price bobby lewis and the absolutely fantastic contours make it all worthwhilei hope tj lubinsky keeps on making shows like this theyre a wonderful experience for all ages'], [u'b00006haxw', u'50', u'professional excellence', u'having worked in television for 34 years i can tell you that this is one of the finest doowop dvds you will ever see it is done with class and a great respect for the talent congratulations to tj lubinsky the producer having been brought up in the bronx and lived through the era of street corner singing i advise you to pick this up today the performance by little anthony and the imperials on &quottwo kinds of people in the world&quot is worth the price alone i have played this piece over and over all the performances are great  buy it  you will be a fan of tj lubinsky and his special admiration for what i was lucky and privileged enough to live through'], [u'b00006haxw',

doesnt matter how old these guys are they can still belt out quite a song  little anthony and the imperials were also very very good  they have recaputured the sounds of the music they way we remembered it  the backup musicians deserve an huge amount of praise this is one you do not want to miss  i recommend it highly'], [u'b00006haxw', u'50', u'another outstanding performance and concert', u'as i stated in my reviews for doo wop 50 and doo wop 51 both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way  frankly i thought little richards appearance was a little pointless and while i enjoyed frankie fords sea cruise both of these performances seemed a little out of place on this show  it seemed like lou christie was straining to hit the high notes at times but hit them he did i was especially impressed with little anthony and the imperials acappella performance of two kinds of people in the world and jay black and the americans performance of cara mia at the very respectable age of 62 is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time you watch it  i wonder why the back up group pure gold which appears on all three shows doesnt get a performance of their own because they are good  this is an excellent addition to anyones dvd library  some notes here  all three of these shows have behind the scenes interviews with various performers  there are five or six on doo wop 50 ten on doo wop 51 and ten or twelve on this one but this is the only one of the three to have bonus tracks of performances of which there are four  there is a listing of the tracks on the back of the dvd case but whoever designed that put them in random order not as they appear on the dvd  the performance listing as it appears on the dvd is as

most of these songs in my after school music class with 5th and 6th graders and they love it  we first sang the songs off lyric sheets and from cds and then watched the dvd  they enjoyed it so much i ordered a dvd copy for each of my students as a present for joining the class  i would suggest ordering the dvd version since it has about eight interviews with artists from the program in addition to six extra songs that arent available on the vhs version  the dvd version is now available only from pbs  the singers may be older than when they first made these songs hits but they can still sing them as well as ever  my only complaint with it is it has five songs by little anthony and the imperials  two would have been enough with maybe a second song from some of the other singers in their place  nevertheless you cant go wrong with either the vhs or dvd version  i prefer the dvd since it includes extra songs and interviews that the vhs version doesnt have'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'50', u'far from home the adventures of yellow dog', u'wellthis just goes to show why you dont blindly accept a critics review i own a yellow lab2 and i can tell you this is a pretty realistic yes i guess the critics would like to see a gloom and doom ending but i dont think they heard of the true story of when one of these trmendously faithful conpanions carried his master half a mile back to his home after he suffered a near fatal heart attackwould have been fatal if not for yellows actions it is a very heartwarming  story without being predictable and just fantastic views the heck with critics buy this because it makes you feel good and that there wasnt a need for explosions or car chases or guns to provide for interesting viewing'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'50', u'spectacular and suspenseful family film', u'the cover of our dvd of far from home says in large letters family feature  and a great family movie it is  but dont make the mistake of thinking that this is just another dog movie in this case the adventures of a labrador named yellow  even more it is about the adventures of his young master angus  angus acquires yellow when the dog appears on the family property apparently lost and soon the boy and his dog become firm friends  when angus and yellow are marooned in wilderness country after the sinking of his fathers ship it is their combined strength that is required to survive the rugged coastline vast forests and hostile wildlifemost of the conflict revolves around this very real struggle against the elements leading up to a suspenseful and heartwarming conclusion  but along with this suspense comes excellent and convincing characterization  more than just an adventure story far from home is ultimately a comingofage story as angus learns about responsibility and survival  in the process his relationships with his father and with his dog are especially wellportrayedalthough the movie is clean i would not recommend this movie for younger children under 10 mainly because of its capacity to evoke strong emotions of fear there are some scary moments involving a sinking ship during a storm a wolf attack and a perilous log crossing over a ravine and grief its hard to hold back the emotions experienced at losing a missing child  but with this depth of emotion older children and adults alike will find it a real tearjerker  when combined with good acting and some lovely cinematography of beautiful rugged british columbia this movie is definitely a drama worth keeping for the family  godly gadfly'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'50', u'a truly wonderful family film', u'i would beg to differ with the above description of the film this is not the typical &quotaboyandhispet&quot film the story is more realistic than the typical film of its genre such as &quotflipper&quot or  &quotlassie&quot and lacks the obvious manipulations of an &quotair  bud&quot the characters look like real people watch how angus little  brother dresses himself anyone who has been around a sixyear old can see  their child dressing like this anguss and yellows fight through the  wilderness is not glossed over or &quotdisneyfied&quot the  cinematography is beautiful this film is wonderful for the whole family  not just for the sixyear old'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'50', u'excellent family movie', u'as owners of a yellow lab we just might be a bit biased but we were mesmerized by this moviethe adventures of a lost boy and dog  of course the ending is predictable  we knew that  but the story line the fabulous scenery the cinematography the acting the subplots and the adventure make this a mustsee movie for the whole family  preview it before showing it to the very young they might be traumatized by the scary partsbuy far from home  a guaranteed winner  youll be watching it over and over again'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'50', u'awesome dog movie', u'you dont have to own a yellow lab to absolutley love this movie but true dog lovers will find it irrestible a young boy takes in a lost yellow lab and despite his parents reservations allow him to keep the dog the boy and the dog become very close and forge a bond that is put to the test when they are lost in boat accident and end up stranded on a remote island the dog stays by the young boys side as they struggle to survive find food and battle a pack of wolves all this happens while his parents and the coast guard desperately search for him after many weeks pass the coast guard believes they may never be found but the dog and the boy do survive as they gain strength through each others love and devotion it has an unusual ending which i dont want to spoil but yellow dog is one movie although simple in structure that really captures the true relationship that a boy and a dog can have that transcends even human friendships'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'50', u'a movie for all ages', u'you dont have to be a kid to enjoy this film  this is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy  it has something for everyone  lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this comingofage wilderness drama  a few scary moments for the young ones but nothing they cant handle  a few sprinkles of romance  lots of dogboy bonding  the ending is predictable for all but the very young but delightful nonetheless  best of all its just a delightful movie free of violence car chases shootouts and antagonists  this movie was engaging from start to finish  on par with the journey of natty gann and a walk in the clouds'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'50', u'great american movie', u'this is by far one of the best american movies that i have seen in a very long time it was indeed a true american reality show'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'30', u'uh oh', u'im sorry to be such a scrooge with christmas rapidly approaching but while watching far from home the adventures of yellow dog tonight it sort of struck me as boring  i was expecting a familyoriented film that focuses on a teenager and his dog struggling to make it after a terrible boat accident leaves them stranded along the rocky coasts of british columbia and the film delivers in that respect but it just *barely* deliversthe entire presentation feels really bloated and exaggerated to me which is typical of early to mid 90s adventure films  a film that certainly looks really good and i imagine a lot of time was devoted to making it and i remember back in the mid 90s how these type of animal movies won the hearts of everyone who had an affection for them but as the years pass and technology and filmmaking changes i find a movie like this just isnt very fun to watch anymorei cant remember if this film was produce by disney but it definitely *feels* like it was  my biggest problem is that the actual survival story between the teenager and his dog was incredibly shallowyes they collect bugs kill animals when they get hungry enough encounter dangerous wildlife animals such as wolves and wild cats but its just not enough  these segments feel undeveloped and uncreative  its just not enough entertainment and doesnt offer a darn thing as far as originality is concerned either  its completely missing anything truly enticingyes the parents are worried that their teenage boy is missing  interesting though that it never seemed to cross the mind of either those searching for the boy or his parents with the exception of one scene that he might be dead  it was also strange how it was just assumed the boy would make it on land  id be flying planes over the ocean firstif that was my son out there missing in the woods you better believe id fear the worst  granted there was one really good emotional segment where the father looks into a mirror and cries his eyes out while his wife comforts him but eh that was just one moment of sincerity surrounded by a subtle belief that the boys life was never *truly* in danger  not very appealing or accurate storytellingthe fact the film is barely 75 minutes long is another problem and even though everyone loves the dramatic and touching ending ive seen better  actually had the entire movie been dramatic and memorable like the ending it would have been even betterpersonally i feel homeward bound is a lot better because that movie utilizes not just a compelling story of animal survival but humor as well  a much better movie than this one'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'50', u'amazing', u'i have no

jesse bradford has learned many survival skills  hes just finishing up a nice canoe  and when he finds a stray dog he adopts him and names him yellowtaking a few days off from school to accompany his dad john bruce davison on a supply run seems like a dream come true  but when they encounter a fierce storm the boat they are in capsizes  john is quickly rescued but the search and rescue teams cant find any trace of angus or yellowthe two have survives and are trying to find their way back to civilization  will they be able to survive and be reunited with their familythis movie is fairly standard and innocuous family fare  it is a little slow at times especially in the beginning while things are set up  it is fairly predictable  but it is entertaining  kids will enjoy it more than their parents  my biggest complaint was actually the short scenes  many things are introduced and resolved too quickly never giving any plot point time to be fully developed  at the same time i did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfyingthe film could have been much better but does grow on you  dont rush out to see it but theres no reason to avoid it either'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'40', u'good family movie', u'our family really enjoys this movie  the story is not terribly predictable and the actors all do a solid job  beautiful scenery and enough action to keep the little ones engaged  should be on dvd  well add it to our collection'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'50', u'far from home adventures of yellow dog', u'i disagree with the reviewers who said the movie was predictable and drawn out  it was a movie with heart and you could feel the main characters plight when he lost his companion  being an animal lover i was pulling for the happy ending of course  i am disneys biggest fan and i love this movie right along with the others ps  i am a grandmother to eleven  thank heavens for disney movies'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'30', u'disappointing', u'i love dogs and i really wanted to love this film  unfortunately i didnt find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers  cant quite put my finger on it but perhaps i didnt find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this  even the dog was not that interesting for some reason perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds  also it seemed that they didnt spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog the movie is short not even 1 1/2 hours its a great family movie and i think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring  the younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog cant be rescued but dont worry as it has a happy ending  its an okay movie but i expected a lot more  i like movies that both kids and adults can enjoy like shrek ii  this is definately one mainly just for the kids  so many things that kids cant or shouldnt watch  this is one that anyone can watch which is a big plus  probably would have been better as a tv movie and would easily fit in a 2hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials'], [u'b00004cqt3', u'10', u'truly bad but not the worst', u'this movie was one of the worst i have ever seen the acting wasnt good it was very predictable and some parts of the plot were competly unnecessary the worst bit of acting was when yellow comes home his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy if you want predictable watch a survival movie what happens almost always is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident they struggle to survive they are found and then brought home far from home is no exception as for unnecessary the whole romance part of this movie was badly done and not needed the girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home and all the while the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse also some parts of this movie might upset young children such as the time he kills a rabbit and when yellow cant be rescued all in all i would not advise anyone to see this movie in fact i would warn against it'], [u'b00004cqt4', u'50', u'whos the man', u'it is a funny movie but i think there is way too much cursing it takes away from the movie'], [u'b00004cqt4', u'40', u'whos the man', u'its a comedy who done it featuring alot of the old school hiphop artists after seeing the movie on bet recently it brought back all of the good memories relating to the actors and the musicians and i went searching to buy a copy'], [u'b00004cqt4', u'40', u'if you want a laugh', u'i wont claim to know all of the rappers that are contained in the movie but it is a good laugh much as car 54 where are you with rosi o is plus dennis leary is great and duff from mtv vj around 199091 also makes a cameovery cute i would recommend this movie for anyone that was a young adult around 1993 or to someone who wants a good laughmj'], [u'b00004cqt4', u'50', u'a classic', u'this is a great movie especially if you were a young adult during the early 90s  dr dre and ed lover are a great pair very funny  dennis leary is hysterical  so many quotable quotes  the parade of rap stars actually enhances the movie its not a serious movie more like really long funny skit'], [u'b00004cqt4', u'40', u'not an oscar contender', u'though it was never an oscar contender it was funny as h***'], [u'b006jiun2w', u'50', u'deep wideranging phonics coverage', u'this video covers phonics to a deep extent and may be a little too much for beginnersmouth movement is included and is an extremely useful learning tool occasionally however they just show the lip movement without showing pictures of the object corresponding to the wordnevertheless my son is a fast learner so it worked out perfectly for us a hidden gem'], [u'b0078v2lcy', u'30', u'a lavish chinese production that ends up being a soapy and pretty loopy revenge drama', u'i had heard a lot of criticism leveled at gao xiaosongs my kingdom complaining that its two disparate halves never really fit together into a cohesive narrative the first part of the film strains for epic grandeur with its story of two orphans being trained in the art and honor of the chinese opera not the singing kind one of the boys sees his family slaughtered in a political maneuver but is saved from imminent death by a wandering opera master and his charge the three form a offbeat family unit which is threatened when their master is humiliated in a challenge with a southern rival the movie fast forwards until the boys are grown and ready to seek a form of retribution as they move into the popular shanghai opera scene in the twenties after this simple story is resolved the second half of the film becomes a loopy bit of revenge fantasy the screenplay twists and turns as secrets are revealed implausibilities mount up and characters have their ulterior motives exposed it is chaotic and tries way too hard but at least its funmany who have unfavorably judged my kingdom tend to proclaim the first half as brilliant and the second half as the weak link i however tend to disagree i thought that the introductory premise was so thin and contrived that i never bought into the dramatic substance of the plot heck two seconds after the boys arrive in shanghai they are greeted by a street parade extolling an upcoming performance of the man who bested their adoptive father 15 years previously hey that was simple these two vagabonds issue a challenge to the opera superstar that somehow gets newspaper coverage and makes them headliners in a opera duel hey that was simple too now they are legends wow thats a lot for their first day in town after the duel the boys must integrate themselves within the existing opera company that includes a defiant leading lady as one steps into the spotlight and an illicit affair the other seeks to avenge his familys murder from so many years ago the remainder of the film plays as a twisty thriller that never feels particularly real but as the convoluted plotting wraps around itself i must admit to being amused by it all it for me was far more entertaining than what had preceded itthe movie itself is elaborately staged the battle sequences and opera numbers have a pleasing overthetop quality 1920s shanghai is lush and gorgeous and the costuming is memorable however it all feels a little flat the leads are attractive enough but they lack a gravitas to convince us they can headline an intended epic i understand they are known pop stars in their country and that makes sense the actor who plays a diabolical police investigator seems like hes about twelve and downplays the drama out of every scene ultimately i think my kingdom tries to accomplish too much i personally wish they would have committed to making it an adult soap opera with no pretensions other than to entertain as is its a bit of a mess i probably liked it for the wrong reasons but its loopiness is not without its charms kgharris 1/12'], [u'b0078v2lcy', u'40', u'my kingdom', u'very good movie and unlike many chinese movies it does not have a totally sad ending where everyone especially the hero gets killed'], [u'b003zg3gam', u'50', u'dont fear the reaper', u'the reaper is a fantastic show filled with wild scenarios on how sam and friends have to catch the different souls that escaped from hell  the only downside of the show was it only lasted two seasons  i already bought the show in hd via xbox live  glad to see it on amazoncom vod  i would have bought from here first if it was available at the time  wish show would come out on bluray  season 2 even got better when the guys move out and get their own apartment  kevin smith directed the pilot episode enjoy'], [u'b004bh1tn0', u'50', u'as crisp as a live recording can be', u'recording with an audience of less than 1000 this dvd feels like a club recording with its dolby ditigal and dts audio sound  host mark mcewen gushes a tad much and the live by request gimmick is not original  still it manages to captivate  fifteen songs one a medley of eight five being from the last album its a collection that defies the ear with the groups tight instrumentals and harmonies  &quotshe keep on coming&quot and &quotyou should be dancing&quot rock the house while &quotsacred trust&quot and &quothow can you mend a broken heart&quot lull the audience into a trance  this recording is unique in that there are plenty of star callins and lots of joking around  its surprising to hear barry sing &quotwoman in love&quot but &quotnights on broadway&quot is once again cut far too short for a song that contains some of their best workthis is as close as a great live recording gets and a dvd well worth owning  &quotone night only&quot is a great live recording as well but nothing matches the intimacy of this presentation'], [u'b004bh1tn0', u'50', u'bee gees  live by request', u'this is an awesome concert because the bee gees are so relaxed and spontaneous  it was even fun listening to the request callins  some of the women said the same things i would have said if i had been able to view it live  love those guys also they performed songs that are not in some of their other recorded concerts  i highly recommend this dvd'], [u'b004bh1tn0', u'40', u'good set', u'of course its really good to hear all the bee gees jams on a

show&performance'], [u'b004bh1tn0', u'50', u'the bee gees rule', u'i own this dvd along with their one night only dvd & i have to tell youi love em both they sound just as good or better as when they

several songs on this dvd ive never heard before but they have become my favorites the bee gees were very playful/silly/funny in this concert which was a treat to see that different aspect of the group'], [u'b004bh1tn0', u'40', u'bee gees fans enjoy', u'this is a fine performance by the bee gees who perform by request probably the most difficult format for live performers  they play most of their songs and most fans might complain about various hits that were omitted  still an enjoyable performance'], [u'b004bh1tn0', u'50', u'wonderful', u'i have been a bee gees fan for years  it is really wonderful to see them again  i love the songs from the new album &quotthis is where i in&quot  it is really great to hear maurice take the lead in two of the songs &quotman in the middle&quot and &quotwalking on air&quot  while barry and robin have beautiful voices i really enjoy listening to maurice sing after all these years it is really great to see and hear the joy they still get from their music and from preforming togetherwhile precious minutes of the show were taken up with requests it was still nice to see their interaction with the fans  i think anyone who is a fan of barry robin and maurice will enjoy this video  i have watched it over and over  it is really sad that we wont have the chance to see the three of them together like this again'], [u'b0071ad95k', u'50',

myself i am going to be showing my bible study group how great is our god tonight as we have a skeptic in our group  i know this video will dispel any doubts she may have about god  the hope video is equally inspiring in a different way more focused on real life rather than creation  it is a compliment to the fruitcake and ice cream video which deals with a real life story of a young college student who comes to know christ'], [u'b0071ad95k', u'50', u'exceptional', u'this is an amazing video for those who are suffering when life hurts most when the bottom falls out when tragedy strikes i

you buy it if youre hurting'], [u'b0071ad95k', u'50', u'terrific dvd for anyone suffering', u'this dvd is the third in the passion 2006 series done by louie giglio  the four videos go in order so it is helpful to see them in order to follow the story throughout all of them  however having said that this is still a very moving presentation about pain suffering and hope  i would recommend this for high school and older for christians and nonchristiansyou can watch this with someone who is suffering and no one has to say a word at the end  it is not intrusive or offensive but is comforting because it is about the god who is truly big enough to comfort anyone in the worst circumstances in life  and everyone experiences them at some point  with this hope presentation and with all of them in the series you definitely will sense that god does the supernatural heavy lifting that no human possibly canexcellent for mentoring teens and older  the audience in the video is largely college age

yourself if you have viewed any of the others hope is a must view as well there really are not any words to describe the experience of viewing hope also there is no statement that can tell you the

alltime favorite movies for escaping from worldly work  jim caviezel and guy pierce have great chemistry and the trials of edmond dantes are laid out although too brief for me in historically correct detaileven though this movie loosely follows dumas book the story has such a karmic ending that it always lifts my sprits'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'great movie', u'love this movie  loved it when it first came out and still love it  awesome shots and wonderful story linejim c is an amazing actor'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'i love a well rounded movie dont you', u'this movie has everything i like

u'50', u'better than the book', u'i love to read and am normally disappointed in the movies which are based on those books this is the exception great believable characters excellent character development and some sword play and action to keep the men in your life interested'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'one of the best adventure movies ever', u'start with great material like the classic book this film is based on use a great director pick great locations assemble an incredible cast mixing well known with newer actors and then adapt the book in a brilliant screenplay and you end up with a movie like this that is everything a movie should be  adventure mystery romance action sequences character and plot development and humor are all combined into a masterpiecethe 1000 page book by dumas is of course a beloved classic with the theme of what would perfect revenge be like  the book has complicated twists and a darker tone with an ending that feels like a let down in many ways  incredibly the screenplay manages to summarize the book and include enough adaptations and a much more positive ending  i cant say enough good about this screenplay and how well this movie adapts an intricate novel that would be impossible to film if you kept strictly to the plot of the novel  the screenplay is perfectly balanced  if you have watched several current adventure movies where the lighting is so dark the action so blurred the characters so poorly developed and the plot so weak that you arent even sure who you are watching and why they are doing whatever it is they are doing on the screen you will appreciate the pacing of this film with clear lighting and a sound track that even grandfather can understandthe acting is perfect with no grandiloquent flourishes but enough idiosyncracy that each character seems perfectly drawn  caviezel just couldnt be better as the lead character dantes who is betrayed by his best friend who marries his girlfriend and sends him to prison for life  dantes meets a wise prisoner with knowledge of a hidden fortune played by the late richard harris and eventually escapes and wreaks a carefully plotted revenge on each and every enemy who had wronged himwithout giving any more of the plot away let me just say that this is the way movies should be and that the whole family will love this movie and watch it again and again as mine hasavailable in several formats and for a great price since this movie has been out for nearly 10 years i definitely recommend this movie highly  five stars'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'awesome', u'i have to say i was so impressed with this movie  it is a great movie and though not a christian movie it has a lot of god themes mingled in between  i highly recommend this movie  i am buying 2 other to give away  see it you will not be disappointed'], [u'b000063w1r', u'40', u'a tale of revenge love adventure and endurance', u'i should have read the book by now  thats what i was thinking as i was halfway through this particular versionthe only movie version ive seen so far  the cast is okay though i think the woman playing mercedes needed to do a better job of enunciating  the hellhole of the prison was portrayed effectively and i totally understand dantes sp desire for revenge although he does learn eventually that living just to get even is not the ideal way to live after all'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'good', u'the movie was great i like it i actually ordered as a gift i already own it  the price was good and so was the delivery  happy with the order'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'an all around great movie', u'the count of monte cristo is an all around great movie you have an excellent story line and plot you get action suspense romance and even a couple of laughs all this in a movie without nudity sex or bad language there is violence but not in the excessive graphic way we have come to expect from hollywood this movie is proof positive that you dont have to have explicit sex language or blood and guts to have a great movie i highly recommend it'], [u'b000063w1r', u'30', u'monte cristo in 2 hour film', u'the count of monte cristo by alexandre dumas is an over1200page voluminous novel how could this superlong drama be fit into two hours this film did that missonimpossible task compared with french tvseries starring gerald depardieu as the count of monte cristo first half of the story is well depicted while the latter part is too brief there is no valentine nearly poisoned by her step mother no haydee former turk princess and the story depends too much on duels so it is more visually described than the original storys deliberate revenge plan but the relief is that alberts role is spared and is given a huge part in this dramaverdict monte

and nearly impossible to suspend disbelief  i will not pretend to write a clinical analysis of moviemaking  i will simply say i have seen this movie twice and plan to see it again nearly unheard of in my case and both times was fully enveloped in this fascinating beautifully told story  that editing and departure from the novel occurred in some points is no surprise just 2 hours but the essence of the story remains the victory of good over evil  tremendous movie'], [u'b000063w1r', u'30', u'the passion of monte cristo', u'we must allow james caviezel to be very good at being lashed i believe in fact it was that aspect of this very performance that landed him the role of jesus in passion of the christ besides that he makes a pretty face along with guy pearce although somehow pearce seems especially short in this film anyways the acting is soso caviezel plays dantes as a whiny little brat guy pearce acts like an evil gremlin and the end ends happily as hollywood must tho it makes the story more lame the one reason to watch michael wincott is excellent and deliciously evil as the prison warden for the chateau dif'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'this movie had a story', u'so much better

again and again'], [u'b000063w1r', u'30', u'goodbut lacking', u'i hate to give this film three stars or rather i hate that a film based on the book of the same title is worthy of only three stars in most cases i do my best to separate my opinions about a piece of literature on one hand and a film based on that literature on the other and theres no question that this film adequately and entertainingly captures the tale of revenge what it lacks is the intricacy of dumass work which really captures the meticulous planning and plotting that go into the protagonists desire for vengeance i cannot fault the film too much as the level of detail required might have made this 2 hr film much much longer which can be a fault unto itself i do recommend this movie and for those who find it compelling i give a far greater recommendation to the book'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'love this movie but hard to find in stores', u'this is a wonderful movie i bought this for my mom she just loves it the process was extreamly fast and hastle free at amazon'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'make sure theyre sitting down when you tell them', u'this is a well done movie of my favourite story to date  theres some time spent in france and then its around the world in a tale that makes me shiver even now  although the book of the same title by alexander dumus was where they got the name and stuff the story does come out a little better than the book in more ways than one  this is not an easy story to put on the silver screen and i think personally this version is the first one you should see  boy has girl boy has a friend boy has his dreams come true boy doing there who me tarzanwhile this movie adeptly manages to come off new and exiting in its production it still manages to fit in to the scheme of things from hollywood and even to this daysplendid acting by the cast and each stands out as if personally involved in the whole idea of the thingthe sets are over the top  there are some mansions and countryestates that make my mouth water even if because of the scene requiring dimly lit rooms'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'in my top 10 great movies', u'actionadventure intrige romance this movie has it allthis isjims finest filmhe was better in this than the passion of the christi have never read the book but i probably will now  there is no relaxing in this movie has it has a lot of twists i am amazed that the casting director could take 3 unknowns and cast them perfectly  in addition the young man that played jims son must be his brother cousinetc in real life because he looks just like himthe end is a little predicatable but very satisfying'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'superb acting and action', u'a very welldone film and an excellent cast  id put it right up with the three and four musketeers movies york reed chamberlain heston etc'], [u'b000063w1r', u'40', u'the count of monte cristo', u'this is an excellent movie and i never read the book  the acting and the

movie and still enjoy watching it again the acting is surperb and the quality of the story is deep entertaining and thought provoking an awesome buy and the purpose of owning is to watch it and watch it again and again if not why not just rent'], [u'b000063w1r', u'40', u'great sleeper movie', u'this is a great movie  that many people dont know about  jim caviezel and guy pearce do great acting  i think after guy pearces performance i wont like him if i ever meet him in real life  he makes his character so dis likable  which is the point'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'a movie that meets the standards of the book', u'this movie is incredible very captivating from beginning to end sensational movie very well done and played out truly stands up to the book which was beautifully written a bit of difference but came out well enough to be a success the count of monte cristo has so much in it a young man innocent trusting and in love losses it all in a second because of his suppose friends jelousy all is taken and all hope seems lost until he meets a friend meanwhile his anger and vengance grow he returns to a whole different world his only thought is revenge but so many twists and turns he doesnt even expect what happens to happen this has innocence betrayel cruelty hardship vengance love and friendship all in one beautiful story a hard era and excellent film the actors were superb jim caviezel a wonderful actor theres just something about him that makes him very interesting to watch those eyes just draw you in and his talent makes him great he was spectacular in this film guy pearce shined his on his own behalf did it so well that you actually hated him in this movie all of the actors were great made it so dramatic it was believable nicely done'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'a classic movie', u'there is nothing bad to say about this movie  the story the acting everything is well done  i bought it to watch over and over'], [u'b000063w1r', u'40', u'innocence turned to revenge', u'very good acting  a bad guy you love to hate  very romantic  feel good story  action  a little adventure and definitive intriguge  it all makes for an excellent story

edge of my seat for more than one scene  i will enjoy watching this movie for years to come'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'the count of monte cristo', u'this is one of the best films i have seen its in great shape i dont remember but it may have been new it works perfectly and i am so lucky to own it'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'an unexpected treat', u'the count of monte cristo was one of my most favorite novels during my teenage years i was skeptical of its yet another remake but decided to give it a try however both my husband and i were pleasantly surprised to find a welldirected movie with superior acting by james caviezel hes done a splendid job by portraying first the innocence of happy youth and then becoming the embodiment of righteous yet calculated revenge i also really enjoyed the fact that the leading characters were not cast by the bigger names save your time and money skip moulin rouge and see this great movie in my opinion it deserves more attention and praise from critics and the media than it has gotten so far'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'excellent movie  you wont pause it for anything', u'the first time i watched this movie my cousin brought it over to my house on a movie night  when she said what she was bringing to watch i said what the count of who  never heard of it and immediately assumed that it would be not worth my timei was mistaken  i could not take my eyes off of the movie and spent the next 2 hours enthralledif you are wondering whether this is worth the moneyspend it youll definately be happy you did'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'&quotyou must look into that storm&quot', u'based on the dumas story this fabulous adventure about a naive illiterate young man in 19th century france whose fate embroils him in treachery and vengeance is well written with wit and intelligence and abridges a complex plot into a cohesive 131 minute filmthe location cinematography in malta and ireland is spectacular though my one and only complaint about this film is that occasionally some of the indoor sequences tend to be a little murkythe soundtrack by edward shearmur is also topnotch and adds a lot to the filmthe castjim caviezel brilliantly captures the essence of the dantes/count character believable both as the innocent edmund and the worldly count of monte cristo with his swashbuckling prowess and elegant stylerichard harris as the priest who mentor dantes is marvelous wily and wise its a perfect part for harris and he makes the most of itother standout performances come from guy peerce as fernand michael wincott as armand dorelac the warden of dif and most of all luis guzman as a very funny jacopothis is terrific family viewing free of the plague of foul language and heavy breathing between the sheets that have made films so tiresome in recent years this film will feed your brain delight your eyes and raise your heartbeat a little with its fastpaced exploits about &quotkings and pawns emperors and fools&quot'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'fabulous entertainment', u'this is by far the best rendition for the big screen of the novel by dumas although its not 100% close to the book and by far one of the best movies in recent yearswhat other movie do you remember going to where at the end while the titles scroll a roar of applause comes from the audience ive lended my dvd to a few skeptic friends and all not only liked the movie they loved itwonderfully acted with wonderful scenery this movie truly deserves more credit that it has gotten stars hands down'], [u'b000063w1r', u'40', u'torment and vengeance', u'if you like movies like braveheart the patriot and gladiator then you will enjoy the count of monte cristorating buy'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'excellent', u'the perfect moviegreat plotexceptional endingmust see movie'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'excellent', u'do you remember having to read this story in high school literature i enjoyed it then and i love it even more now  the movie graphics are so much better than my imagination  it has all of the essentials to satisfy both mine and my husbands movie expectations  romance intrigue sword fights action definitely a movie to add to your collection'], [u'b000063w1r', u'40', u'excellent  if you dont want to watch count of monte cristo', u'yes it is called count of monte cristo but lets just say that the story bears little resemblance to the literature yes edmond dantes is wrongly imprisoned and meets someone there that helps him get out and rain misfortunes down on those who were responsible for his time in the chateau dif thats pretty much where the similarities end the methods of revenge in the movie are much less imaginative basically consisting of him telling them he is dantes and then killing them these replace dumas genius methods  economic ruin mental insanity suicide etchowever if you dont want to commit to reading a 1500 page book and cant devise a way to see the play adaptation you will never know the differences and this is a good movie just take it on its own merits rather than on the books'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'our family rates this as one of our favorite movies', u'this is one of our favorite movies  we seldom like to see a movie more than twice  however this movie was so entertaining as well as it contained excellent drama acting and a well developed plot that we have viewed it numerous times  my teenage kids as well as my younger boys enjoyed the movie  i did have to reexplain some moral issues & contradictions concerning the implied premarital sex and adultery  we used the theme of revenge vs forgiveness as a discussion tool it was also refreshing to see a movie with positive references to god and still be exciting  we are going to read the book this summer and we dont expect the book and the movie to be exactly the same  they are two different expressions'], [u'b000063w1r', u'50', u'amazing film  but with a couple of minor glitches', u'ill admit ive not read the original source novel on which this is based the only thing by dumas i have read is the classic musketeers life is too short to read every great novel try as one might  but having seen this film i am determined to seek out the text judging the film on its own terms i found this immensely satisfying and though quite long 131 min it does not drag for a second the story itself is really quite something and no matter how many films you have seen or books you have read you will be absolutely bowled over as george bernard shaw was by the breadth depth simplicity and universality of it there are some minor faults with the film sometimes the dialogue seems a little stilted eg guy pearce an australian who has mastered a range of accents seems a little too much of a cookiecutter villain daniel daylewis did a much better job in gangs of new york there is something faintly unsatisying about the conclusion no matter how memorable it may be  but even compared with barry lyndon kubrick this is still a riveting assured adaptation these are very minor quibbles and i would put this in with some of my favourite films along with captain blood errol flynn koyanisquaatsi new cinema paradiso and celebration aka festen generally the script is absolutely top notch full of little throwaway quips and putdowns the cast is absolutely stunning especially james calaziel absolutely convincing in his metamorphosis from naive youth to coldblooded avenger watch out for luis guizman as a scheming pirate very highly recommended for those who seek something a little more highbrow than the standard multiplex schlock'], [u'b000063w1r', u'40', u'a nice adaptation of dumass clasic novel', u'a film by kevin reynoldsthis is the recent film adaptation of dumass classic novel the count of monte cristo  from the previews and early reviews of the movie i did not expect too much from it but when someone whose opinion i trust tells me that it is good and that i should watch it i was willing to give it a chance  good thing because this is a pretty good movie  the story if you are not familiar with the source material follows edmond dantes jim caviezel  dantes in the film is a sailor and the film opens with dantes and his friend fernand mondego guy pierce trying find refuge on an island because their captain is dying  the island just happens to be the prison island where napoleon is exiled and while they get help napoleon asks dantes if he could take a personal and innocent letter to a friend  dantes agrees  dantes returns to france and does not have a chance to deliver the letter though we do see his fianc&eacute mercedes iguanada dagmara dominczyk and a little bit of mondegos jealousy  dantes is betrayed and turned into the authorities for treason  that innocent letter that dantes was to deliver was not so innocent after all  the magistrate has dantes thrown in prison where he will spend the next several years  this is where the movie truly begins  dantes was innocent and he was betrayed we soon learn that mondego is now married to mercedes and he wants his revenge though he has no avenue to pursue his revenge while in prison  while in prison dantes meets abbe faria richard harris a man who is digging a tunnel slowly inch by inch to escape  faria trains dantes in the sword teaches him how to read science literature politics and how to be a noble  he also tells dantes of a treasure the treasure of monte cristo that may or may not exist  we wouldnt have a story if dantes is unable to escape or pursue his revenge so im not spoiling anything by revealing that  dantes sets himself up as the count of monte cristo with the help of a man named jacopo luis guzman  dantes is now free to pursue his revenge  the story feels like it has been simplified a little bit but this film is good enough and slick enough and entertaining enough that this is a very enjoyable movie to watch  no film can ever capture the nuance of a novel especially not a 1000 page novel  with the amount of time allotted this film the count of monte cristo succeeds at being an entertaining film'], [u'b000063w1r', u'30', u'greatuntil the ending', u'i read the monte cristo book a few months before the movie came out and i adored it so i was really pumped up to see it on screen first off the actors were perfectly casted and the director did a great job adapting the book to film buti have to take points off for the ending whenever a book is made into a movie the plot is tweaked and molded to be more entertaining visually my issue was not just that the ending was changed it was the complete opposite of what happened in the book it was totally ridiculous it was exactly what you would expect to happen even though it was totally unrealistic thats why i gave it only three stars if youre speaking in terms of overall cinematic experience its a wonderful film i suggest that you read the book first see the movie and judge for yourself or if youve already seen the film go r']]\n"
