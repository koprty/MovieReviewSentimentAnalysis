B00008AOTZ///A2FE2RTCPU344H///Edan Tasca///21/22///1.0///1051056000///Welcome to the Bungle///This DVD shouldn't even get one star - it's not nearly that good. Simply put, this DVD is an embarrassment to anyone who had anything to do with it. <p>There are no interviews with the band, just a few 2- or 3-second clips from one interview with Slash, Izzy, and Duff. There is no GnR music in the show, nor is there concert footage of any kind.<p>If you know nothing about the band, you may learn a few things. But many of the "facts" are false (it was Izzy who urinated on the plane, guys, not Slash), and those facts that are true can easily be found on any GnR website. There's no insight worth noting. If you love the band, you'll be insulted by the low quality of content and mailed-in production values.<p>Not only are many facts wrong, the narrator didn't even put in enough effort to learn the band members' names - she mispronounces the names Adler and Stradlin. The interviewees are meager - a pair of fans is prominently featured. <p>The ultimate disgrace? One of the interviewees actually says something about "Slash and Alex..."<p>Alex? Alex Rose?<p>That's right. W. Alex Rose. And that should tell you all you need to know about this DVD. It's gonna bring you down.
B00008AOTZ///ABCKTG6GQUSNU///Lord Kayoss///13/13///1.0///1084579200///Complete Garbage!///This documentary could've been made by a high school multi-media student - even a flunky one.  &quot;Chrome Dreams&quot;, the company claiming responsibility behind this atrocity put together a couple of photos (showed them over and over), some cheesy footage, and got a handful of know-nothings to tell you the GN'R story in a dozen different ways you already know.  There is no exclusive interviews with any of the band members - just some old footage of Slash, Duff, and Izzy shot years ago on the road.  Axl is no where to be found other than the photos.  And, there is absolutely no Guns N' Roses music any where on the disc.  Ultimately, this documentary does nothing for the avid Gunner and looks like a home made movie.  Waste of $20.00 for sure.  Hopefully, VH-1's &quot;Behind the Music&quot; style documentary will be more worthy of our time than this monstrosity.

6302338425///A2BBZ3NI8MWH93///VD2400///16/16///5.0///1134172800///FOR THE WORLD!///To tell you the truth, I love this movie. Bette Midler can act in anything-comedy or drama-anything! But I like her most in drama. This movie was Bette Midler's second Academy Award nomination. Directed by the same man who directed the movie The Rose (also with Bette Midler-her first Academy Award nomination).<br /><br />I find this movie to be delightful, funny, heartbreaking, and VERY well acted!<br /><br />Bette Midler sings in this movie, and it only adds to the superior quality of the film. The acting, the story, the music is worth watching over and over again. Like I said, I love this movie, and I recommend it to one and all!
6302338425///A1BKGGKR8FI97M///B. Formund///3/3///4.0///1252454400///Bette Midler at her Best///If you like 1940s music and strong women this is the movie for you.  Bette Midler plays a vocalist who gets mixed up with a "player" comedian (James Caan) while doing USO tours from WWII through Viet Nam.  Sometimes funny, often sad, it's just a great story told through flashbacks of her life when she's an old woman.  Great supporting cast as well.
6302338425///A22RNOYOWQYOU5///Christy K "Christy/Lover of films"///2/2///5.0///1262476800///For the Boys/Great Film///I loved this film, touching, nostalgic, and very well acted.  It was highly under-rated, for whatever reason I can not understand!  So was "It's a Wonderful Life"! , another classic!!  "For the Boys"  brings tears to my eyes each time I see it.  Wonderful singing, dancing,  and performances by both Bette Midler and James Cann, certainly one of Bette's greatest films.  Anyone who has experienced WW II, Korea, Vietnam, or any of the wars of this century can appreciate this film.  It will touch your heart.  I highly recommend it and give it 5 stars  *****.  I saw it when first in theaters and many times again. Always superb and touching!
6302338425///ACAV6HZSJGUR1///R. MacTaggart///2/2///5.0///1191801600///AN OVERLOOKED GEM! MIDLER IS INCREDIBLE!///I have never understood the reaction so many people and critics have had to this film.<br /><br />In short: this is a great movie. I am as baffled today as I was upon its initial release that it did not do well. Bette (who has had an uneven movie career) is simply great here; brilliant. She SHOULD have won an Oscar. She is electric in her almost every scene. The early big number where she first sings for Eddie is magic, exhilarating, joyous, and a delight. Bette is at her very best in this long number. Even her hands and arms; watch what she does with them.<br /><br />The supporting players are also wonderful. I particularly enjoyed the subtly, grace, and charm displayed by Arye Gross (impossibly young!). The scenes in Vietnam with Christopher Rydell (as Bette's beloved movie son Danny) are also superbly played by the actor. You really feel the stunning transition from his pro-war beliefs to his shocking disillusionment.<br /><br />The brief Vietnam scenes also portray the hubris of Vietnam better than most feature-length films on the subject. No small achievement.<br /><br />What I also liked about the film was the utter disparity between the public's viewpoint of the two Beloved Stars and their own truth. I also enjoyed the many issues touched upon - no easy task to do in 138 minutes.<br /><br />Yes, there are problems. I did not like the casting of James Cann in 1991 and still do not although I usually enjoy the actor. And yes, the Old Make-up is a disaster and utterly distracting.<br /><br />Film history is full of overlooked gems. FOR THE BOYS is one such film. Remember, people did not like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE when it came out! Nor the WIZARD OF OZ!
6302338425///A14D63XS7C1GN///W. Wilkinson///2/2///5.0///1108425600///For this boy ...///Many moons ago I received the DVD of "Norma Rae," and there was a trailer included in the special features for "For the Boys."  The trailer featured Bette's character singing "In My Life" during the Vietnam War, while flashes of history are played on the screen.  Perhaps needless to say, I CRIED my eyes out while watching this!  It made me believe that the movie would be outstanding, or, at least, as emotional as that song.  Anyway, I was looking forward to seeing it, and bought it for cheap somewhere.<br /><br />AS USUAL I had to watch the movie a few times before I really started appreciating it, and now I can say that I love it, DESPITE the scathing reviews it received.  But I do agree on a few points:<br /><br />Unfortunately, the best part of the entire movie is the first forty minutes or so, and considering the movie is two-and-one-half hours long, that perhaps isn't saying much.  But watching Bette perform in these scenes is enough to sustain you throughout the rest.  Basically, you just wind up wishing the movie would "pick up," but you're stuck waiting for the other half of a one-two punch; it never REALLY comes.<br /><br />The entire movie in itself IS emotional, cute, funny, tragic ... all the adjectives you'd expect.  But all of these things working together don't add up to a perfect whole.  And the ending is somewhat unsatisfying.  It's the ending we were expecting, but ... it could have been executed a bit better.  At times it seems as though it were a TV-movie.  And everyone complains about the age makeup, but ... this was 1990; this was "For the Boys," not "Lord of the Rings."<br /><br />All-in-all it's the songs and one-liners that are going to stay with you, and, again, Bette's performance in those first forty minutes.  I guess I'm just biased, but ... I believe this movie DOES have an audience if you're open-minded, and can view this as a flawed masterpiece.  If you've read any entertainment "news" from 1991, then you'd know that Bette's own production company brought "For the Boys" to fruition, and it was truly a love-letter to all her fans.<br /><br />Maybe sometime before the 2000s are over she'll have one more big hit, and maybe she'll finally get an Oscar.  I hope.  :)
6302338425///A26D5IRV2OLU4B///D. Munro///1/1///5.0///1237766400///I'll Remember ... YOU!///That final line of the movie is only part of what makes it so wonderful.<br /><br />Bette Midler plays Dixie opposite James Caan's Eddie.  When they meet, neither is impressed with the other ... however, both deliver magic when onstage in front of thousands of GIs.  With great comic timing and spectacular chemistry, they stumble into a partnership that will take them through three different wars, joys and tragedies.  They're more than friends, more than performing partners ... and their unique relationship lasts decades.  They see ups and downs, have fights and disagreements, but in the end come together FOR THE BOYS.<br /><br />Bette Midler and James Caan are fantastic in this movie. The music is wonderful as well.  One of Bette's best!
6302338425///A1V2D52LYB09P9///R. Michels///1/1///3.0///1219708800///A must have Bette Midler movie!///The best of Bette in this movie.  You've got her wonderful singing voice, her comedic acting, her serious dramatic acting....everything.  This movie has all of what you expect from Bette Midler.  James Caan adds just the right amount of talent but pales in comparison to Bette Midler.  You've got to get this movie to add to your library.

6302338425///A24JJCNEEP2MT4///Jim LaRegina (jimlaregina@hotmail.com)///2/3///4.0///934761600///Thanks for the date and FOR THE BOYS///I invited a date to the movies and when she picked FOR THE BOYS, I cringed a little.  But I liked FOR THE BOYS a lot, as it turned out. Predictable, well, yeah, but it conveys the unavoidable intimacy of the long, albeit  working, relationship of the characters portrayed by James Caan and Bette  Midler.  And in addition to the two lead actors, George Segal turns in a  good performance.  See FOR THE BOYS.

6302338425///A14Y2BFP2PTJP2///Endora Aphrattos "Endora Aphrattos"///0/0///5.0///1346803200///P.S. I LOVE You!///I've heard all of the rumors and arguments about this film there are... Well, I believe I have at least, but, people are strange critters so who knows.  Was this written from a script of Martha Raye's life story and reworked or based on anyone's?  Is some of the music from the wrong time period?  Other goofs?  It's wrong to analyze anything to death and that's what happened with this film when it was released.  I ADORE Martha Raye and for one hope there is no truth in that gossip.  I LOVE this film and am pleased it was made regardless of whether it was even remotely true or not.  Was the music from the wrong time period?  I think someone is entirely TOO critical if they worry about that minute detail.  Even if the song was played in its entirety in the film, it's not THE WHOLE film just a few minutes of it and all the songs worked!  I LOVED it!  If it had anything to do with anyone's life, living or dead, this is a dramatization of an era.  It should feel real, but, needn't be 100% so.  This is the story of two entertainers, how they met, formed a team, their ups and downs and the tragedies they shared through three wars.  It touches my heart to watch this woman's story.  Bette Midler is sensational in the film.  Even James Caan is a surprising delight.  If you have not seen this, you must.  It is comedy, drama, romance... Life.  Watch it without scrutiny and you will enjoy it and be happy it's in your collection.
6302338425///ANCOMAI0I7LVG///Andrew Ellington///0/0///3.0///1339113600///See it for Midler...///I love James Caan, and I have this thing for Bette Midler (the same thing I have for Barbara Streisand apparently) so I was kind of excited to watch `For the Boys'.  My cinephille friends who had seen the film were pessimistic and basically told me that I only needed to see it for the mere fact that Midler received an undeserved Oscar nomination and that I was most likely going to hate the film.<br /><br />I didn't.<br /><br />That isn't to say that I loved it or even really liked it, for there is a lot about this film that doesn't work, but it isn't loathsome and Midler's Oscar nomination is far from undeserved.  In fact, I actually found her more engaging, entertaining and deserving than the actual Oscar winner that year (but my relationship with Jodie Foster is not a good one).  Still, as much as I didn't hate this, and as much as I found both Midler and Caan good in their respective roles, there is just too much about `For the Boys' that misses the mark.<br /><br />Midler plays a singer named Dixie Leonard who gets picked up by Eddie Sparks, a showman who wants her for a USO tour during World War II.  Together, they make an odd pair.  Dixie is fearless and sassy and sexy and literally throws caution to the wind while giving the `boys' exactly what they want, while Eddie is initially turned off by her crude humor and undeniable appeal.  The two barrel through their differences and create a force that spans fifty years and remains tumultuous throughout.<br /><br />Here is where the film gets sticky.  I mean, you are covering a lot of ground and basically focusing on two people solely.  The script doesn't truly flesh out these characters as a `couple' and so the audience isn't necessarily drawn to them in that light.  The whole thing feels rather anti-climactic, even though it is certainly going to the climactic.  It wants you to be moved to tears when these two are finally reunited, but by the time Dixie is done telling her story you are pretty much removed from her plight and could care less if she and Eddie ever see one another again.  The pretty simple resolve of all things negative is also a tad unrealistic and gives the film a sense of pointlessness, like the feud and obvious reservations, especially on Dixie's end, were unnecessary.  Also, the span of time gets in the way because it tries to tell is so much but the reflective nature of the film (focusing on that relationship) almost gives it a redundancy, which hurts the film considering that it feels like a hodgepodge of scenes which serve no purpose but to remind us that Dixie and Eddie don't get along but can't live without each other.<br /><br />And still, Midler is explosive and engaging and just so much fun to watch.  Her voice, her sass, her complete control of her environment is stunning to witness and I would recommend watching it for her and her alone.  Caan is very good and holds his own, but his character is certainly not as entertaining as that of Dixie.<br /><br />Still, the mediocre direction and the poor scripting (and that god-awful makeup) make this film less that it could have been.

6302338425///A2HIWDD2TDXS19///F. Gentile///8/13///2.0///1072569600///For The Desperate.///This was one of those movies that really sounded great with possibilities, but just fell flat. The premise of two show-biz veterans, who have a love/hate (mostly hate) relationship, through 50 years of entertaining together in the  U.S.O., television, amid changing public tastes, tragedies, ups, downs, wars, etc...should have made for a very entertaining saga. And, with Bette Midler as the musical female lead, how could it miss? Well, it did. Though it gets off to a promising start, and her number "Stuff Like That There" early in the film brings down the house in true Bette style, it went downhill from there. James Caan is opposite her as her sexist partner/nemesis, whose  pairing with her, though a big success career wise, is rife with rivalry and contempt for the very success that the fluke of their pairing produces. They chew the scenery often, and certain scenes,  such as when Bette's characters son is killed in front of her in VietNam, where she is entertaining,  that are so stupidly overwrought that they are rendered emotionless. I actually went to a theater to see this movie, something I don't often do. What I still remember most about that experience is the collective audience reaction, of incredulous hilarity, when the "aged" Midler and Caan's characters meet after many years of non-communication for a begrudged public reunion. This is by far the worst "aging" make-up job that I have ever seen in a big budget motion picture... all the improbability of this movie came to a ridiculous head at the viewing of these supposed very elderly stars, who look more like burn victims, in mid-meltdown, than any elderly person I've ever known. This is a very over-long disappointment, the only value of which will be in a few musical clips that will no doubt be used in  the inevitable retrospective of Bette Midler's career. Best forgotten, which it mostly is.
6302338425///ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV///Gary F. Taylor "GFT"///2/4///3.0///1088380800///Watchable, But Nothing To Write Home About///Seemingly suggested by a combination of Bob Hope's legendary USO tours and the toxic relationship that sometimes develops between comedy team partners (with the likes of Martin and Lewis a case in point), FOR THE BOYS gives us the story of Dixie Leonard (Midler), a rough and tough singer with a naughty sense of humor, and Eddie Sparks (James Caan), a secretly sexist comic.  When the two meet on a World War II USO tour, it's loathing at first sight--but their audiences adore the combination.<p>Trouble is, you can't imagine why.  Both Midler and Caan are expert performers, but they have remarkably little on-screen chemistry, and although they score points individually they never quite seem to be working in tandem.  To make matters worse, while the dialogue is often witty, the plot is leaden, and it promptly goes off into a host of predictable directions as it drags its characters from World War II to Vietnam in order to make a series of well-intended but extremely obvious and over-worked comments about changing times and the wastefulness of war.<p>The supporting cast is strong, but like the leads they seem to be pulling in different directions throughout the film, and when all is said and done this rather lengthy film feels quite a bit longer than it actually is.  Midler's songs are the only real highlight, and the thing is indeed watchable... but only just.  The DVD package isn't anything to write home about either, consisting of a handful of trailers and television spots.  For hardcore Midler fans only.<p>GFT, Amazon Reviewer
