B003AI2VGA///A141HP4LYPWMSR///Brian E. Erland "Rainbow Sphinx"///7/7///3.0///1182729600///"There Is So Much Darkness Now ~ Come For The Miracle"///Synopsis: On the daily trek from Juarez, Mexico to El Paso, Texas an ever increasing number of female workers are found raped and murdered in the surrounding desert. Investigative reporter Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) arrives from Los Angeles to pursue the story and angers both the local police and the factory owners who employee the undocumented aliens with her pointed questions and relentless quest for the truth.<br /><br />Her story goes nationwide when a young girl named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talancon) survives a vicious attack and walks out of the desert crediting the Blessed Virgin for her rescue. Her story is further enhanced when the "Wounds of Christ" (stigmata) appear in her palms. She also claims to have received a message of hope for the Virgin Mary and soon a fanatical movement forms around her to fight against the evil that holds such a stranglehold on the area.<br /><br />Critique: Possessing a lifelong fascination with such esoteric matters as Catholic mysticism, miracles and the mysterious appearance of the stigmata, I was immediately attracted to the '05 DVD release `Virgin of Juarez'. The film offers a rather unique storyline blending current socio-political concerns, the constant flow of Mexican migrant workers back and forth across the U.S./Mexican border and the traditional Catholic beliefs of the Hispanic population. I must say I was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfolds.<br /><br />`Virgin of Juarez' is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again, but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing. Minnie Driver delivers a solid performance and Ana Claudia Talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary Mariela. Also starring Esai Morales and Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart).
B003AI2VGA///A328S9RN3U5M68///Grady Harp///4/4///3.0///1181952000///Worthwhile and Important Story Hampered by Poor Script and Production///THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez, Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso, Texas.  The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light, but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director.<br /><br />Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple (in the hundreds) killings of young women. The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work, raped, beaten and killed.  Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies, in part due to her own past issues of being too idle with similar crimes in the US.  She meets Father Herrera (Esai Morales) and a community activist Patrick (Angus MacFadyen) and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder, discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talanc&oacute;n), a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary.  A father of one of the victims, Isidro (Jorge Cervera, Jr.) nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital, placing her in a 'church' where she becomes a 'saint' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end.  Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims' families.  Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators, taking a sheet of photos of 'most wanted men' from the police office of Detective Lauro (Jacob Vargas), and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez. Fearing for Mariela's life, they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story.<br /><br />The squeaky, mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson.  Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism, the story would possibly have been better related.  There are some good performances by Driver, Talanc&oacute;n, Morales, and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality.  Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema.  It is sad when script and the production dull the impact.  Grady Harp, June 07
B003AI2VGA///A1I7QGUDP043DG///Chrissy K. McVay "Writer"///8/10///5.0///1164844800///This movie needed to be made.///The scenes in this film can be very disquieting due to their graphic re-enactment of real events, but this story needs to be told. I will say the violence was injected into the movie with as much taste as manageable when dealing with rape scenes, etc. Inspired by true events, women are being murdered in Juarez after they leave the factory where they work. A fearful community is suddenly given some hope when one of the young victims not only lives, but experiences 'stigmata' after seeing the Virgin Mary.  I was shocked to learn that murders in Juarez are still happening and many are unsolved. I believe this director brought a very important story to the surface. Though it's never pleasant to think about young women being murdered, this movie depicts a harsh reality of the high cost of exploited-cheap labor.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B003AI2VGA///A1M5405JH9THP9///golgotha.gov///1/1///3.0///1197158400///distantly based on a real tragedy///THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ (2006)<br />directed by Kevin James Dobson<br />approx. 1 hour 25 minutes<br /><br />The town of Juarez, Chihuahua in Mexico is just across the border from El Paso, Texas.  It is home to several factories owned by American companies who employ Mexicans at very low wages.  Since the early 1990s, Juarez has also been the murder site of hundreds of women.  There is a lot of debate as to whether the deaths are the work of a drug gang or a serial killer.  It has also been suggested that due to the local police department's failure to solve the crimes, new rapists and thugs have moved to the area knowing that they will never be caught.  The situation is an overwhelming tragedy and this movie uses the story as a backdrop.<br /><br />We start off seeing how unsafe women feel as they walk and work in Juarez.  Then we meet the hard-headed American journalist played by Minnie Driver.  She aggressively questions the local police and befriends a Catholic priest.  Within the first twenty minutes or so, we see the terrifying reality of the situation in Juarez.<br /><br />At this point, the story jumps from something that might have happened to something that is only found in this movie.  A woman named Mariela survives an brutal attack but is in critical condition in a small hospital.  While the priest is speaking to her, she lets out a howl... and her hands begin bleeding*.  This "stigmata" is meant to show that she has been blessed by the Virgin Mary.  Our reporter protagonist clashes with various authorities on what should be done.  Meanwhile Mariela goes underground and attracts a devoted following, eventually landing her own radio show (!) and living under the protection of gang members, whom she refers to as "modern warriors".  The only thing missing is "Jes&uacute;s Malverde".<br /><br />Now I understand that we don't know everything about the Juarez murders and that a screenwriter has to "fill in the blanks" when crafting an exciting dramatization.  However if you are going to deviate so far from the true story, then don't preface your movie as being "based on the ongoing unsolved murders in Cuidad Juarez".  There is plenty of interesting and legitimate information in the REAL stories of Juarez and there is no need to fabricate.  This movie may "raise the issue" of the Juarez women, but it isn't really about them at all!<br /><br />If you are interested in learning more about the killings in Juarez, there are a few documentaries.  A recent one from Las Perlas Del Mar Films is simply titled 'JUAREZ' and is a good introduction.  Zulma Aguiar's 'JUAREZ MOTHERS FIGHT FEMICIDE' (focuses on the families) is also easy to find.  There is another one which I haven't seen titled 'BORDER ECHOES'.<br /><br />*- note to Hollywood:<br />the nails that crucified Jesus were through his wrists, not his palms!

The fear and death continue.<br /><br />Director Kevin Dobson has brought us Michael Fallon's screenplay THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ to the screen as a fanciful/possible solution to what may be happening down in Juarez.Though this is but a film, the information about the unsolved murders and the religious fanaticism in the area is crucial.<br /><br />Suggested companion film would be AGNES OF GOD.
B003AI2VGA///A3QYDL5CDNYN66///abra "a devoted reader"///0/0///2.0///1229040000///Pretty pointless fictionalization///The murders in Juarez are real. This movie is a badly acted fantasy of revenge and holy intercession.  If there is a good movie about Juarez, I don't know what it is, but it is not this one.
B003AI2VGA///AQJVNDW6YZFQS///Charles R. Williams///3/11///1.0///1164153600///This is junk, stay away///Mexican men are macho rapists, gangsters or ineffective bureaucrats.

There are self-serving corporate types and even a pushy, culturally-insensitive liberal female reporter.<br /><br />The story is absurd, the characters are unbelievable, the stereotypes are offensive.
B00006HAXW///AD4CDZK7D31XP///Anthony Accordino///64/65///5.0///1060473600///A  Rock N Roll History Lesson///Over the past few years, public television has put on a series of vintage &quot;Doo Wop&quot;  and Rock 'N' Roll concert reunions that have been absolutely flawless.  This latest dvd &quot;Rock, Rhythm And &quot;Doo Wop&quot;, is a total delight to ones ears.  Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era, when vocal talent was essential, to get a recording contract?  They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology, which enables many modern day artist's with limited ability to survive?  This dvd reads like a who's who of early rock.  The architect of rock, Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of &quot;Keep-A Rockin&quot;, and the line-up that follows, keeps this concert at a premium level of performances.  You get to see and hear Lou Christie, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Joey Dee and the Starliters, Frankie Valli, Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours, just to name a few.  However, nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans?  After singing &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, Jay gave a performance, that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again.  As he prepared to sing &quot;Cara Mia&quot;, he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25, and must now at age 62, hit those same notes?  Hit those notes he did!  Using that opera trained voice, he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it's feet, showering him with a well deserved standing ovation.  If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50's and 60's, this is an absolute must have dvd.  I highly recommend this to everyone, who enjoys those golden oldies.
B00006HAXW///A3Q4S5DFVPB70D///Joseph P. Aiello///26/26///5.0///1041292800///A  MUST-HAVE  video if you grew up in the 50's or 60's///I recvd this video (DVD version) as a Christmas gift.  I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like, and finally got dragged to bed about 4:30 in the morning.  It's the best "Oldies" video I've ever seen.  It was recorded LAST YEAR by the original singers - now mostly in their 60's, and they're still great - Jay and the Americans, Lou Christie, The Five Satins, Little Richard, Kathy Young, Little Anthony, The Fleetwoods, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Frankie Valli and about 10 other acts.  These guys sing for sheer pride and the love of singing, and it all shows.  It's a concert for PBS patrons filmed in Pittsburgh, PA, and distributed around the country to donors.  They mention that this was the third concert, and I want ALL of them.  Although the Amazon notes say this is a black and white video it is actually in color and very well produced.  The producer in fact is just a kid -only about 30 years old - but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect, and truly celebrates their works. The DVD also has about an hour of excellent interviews.
B00006HAXW///A2P7UB02HAVEPB///"bruce_from_la"///24/24///5.0///1061164800///If You Like DooWop You Gotta Have This DVD///Wow! When I saw this show on PBS--that was it, I had to have this!  What great tunes!  And seeing these groups--terrific! I couldn't find a list of songs, so here's some of them: Keep-a-Knockin--Little Richard; Sea Cruise--Frankie Ford; A Thousand Stars--Kathi Young (still cute!) and the Innocents; Silhouettes by the Rays; Do You Love Me--The Contours; Have You Heard--The Duprees; over 40 songs in all, including Little Anthony, The Five Satins, Lloyd Price, The Skyliners, The Fleetwoods, Jay &amp; the Americans (This Magic Moment, Cara Mia and Come a Little Bit Closer!); Lou Christie; plus Franki Valli and Jerry Butler as hosts. Plus interviews with Kathi Young, Lou Christie and the producer TJ Lubinski (thanks TJ!)
B00006HAXW///A2TX99AZKDK0V7///Henrique Peirano///22/23///4.0///1039564800///I expected more.///I have the Doo Wop 50 and 51 DVDs, and was anxiously waiting for Rock, Rhythm and Doo Wop to arrive. From the first video, which featured the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the 50s groups, to Doo Wop 51, it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production. Better lighting, better stage layout, and better sound quality.<br />Sadly, in terms of editing, they went overboard this time. Excessive use of pre-recorded clapping and cheering really irritated me. There are times where you can hardly hear the singing, because the pre-recorded cheering was so loud. Imagine 5 stadiums hosting the Super Bowl all crammed into one theater. It's simply too artificial. We want not only the authentic groups, but also the authentic reaction from who was there. And believe me, we don't need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groups.<br />For whoever edited the show, I would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at Doo Wop 51 for better camera angles of the groups.<br />Is this DVD worth buying? Definately, because groups/singers Fred Parris &amp; The Satins, Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials, Little Richard, The Limelites, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Bobby Lewis, and the absolutely fantastic Contours make it all worthwhile.<br />I hope TJ Lubinsky keeps on making shows like this, they're a wonderful experience for all ages.

It is done with class and a great respect for the talent. Congratulations to T.J. Lubinsky the producer. Having been brought up in the Bronx and lived through the era of street corner singing I advise you to pick this up today. the performance by Little Anthony and the Imperials on &quot;Two Kinds of People In The World&quot; is worth the price alone. I have played this piece over and over. All the performances are great - buy it - you will be a fan of TJ Lubinsky and his special admiration for what I was lucky and privileged enough to live through.

You will never regret buying this DVD.

Thomas///4/4///5.0///1177804800///Unbelievable Best Concert!///This video is awesome and of particular interest to anyone who grew up with the great music of the 50's and 60's.  The Duprees were wonderful!  Also, Jay Black's Cara Mia gave me goose bumps.  It doesn't matter how old these guys are, they can still belt out quite a song.  Little Anthony and the Imperials were also very, very good!  They have recaputured the sounds of the music they way we remembered it!  The backup musicians deserve an huge amount of praise. This is one you do not want to miss!  I recommend it HIGHLY!
B00006HAXW///AFJ27ZV9183B8///Michael A. Martin///3/3///5.0///1200096000///Another outstanding performance and concert.///As I stated in my reviews for Doo Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51, both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way.  Frankly, I thought Little Richard's appearance was a little pointless, and while I enjoyed Frankie Ford's Sea Cruise, both of these performances seemed a little out of place on this show.  It seemed like Lou Christie was straining to hit the high notes at times, but hit them he did. I was especially impressed with Little Anthony and the Imperials acappella performance of "Two Kinds of People in the World", and Jay Black and the Americans' performance of Cara Mia (at the very respectable age of 62) is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time you watch it.  I wonder why the back up group Pure Gold, which appears on all three shows, doesn't get a performance of their own, because they are good.  This is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD library.  Some notes here:  all three of these shows have behind the scenes interviews with various performers.  There are five or six on Doo Wop 50, ten on Doo Wop 51, and ten or twelve on this one, but this is the only one of the three to have bonus tracks of performances, of which there are four.  There is a listing of the tracks on the back of the DVD case, but whoever designed that put them in random order, not as they appear on the DVD.  The performance listing as it appears on the DVD is as follows:<br /><br />Keep A Knocking - Little Richard<br />Sea Cruise - Frankie Ford<br />A Thousand Stars - Kathy Young and the Innocents<br />Silhouettes - The Rays<br />Do You Love Me - Contours<br />Have You Heard and You Belong to Me - Duprees<br />Peppermint Twist - Joey Dee and the Starlighters<br />For Your Love - Ed Townsend<br />Romeo and Juliet - Reflections<br />Lightning Strikes - Lou Christie<br />Tears on My Pillow, Shimmy Shimmy Ko Ko Bop, Two Kins of People in the World, Hurt So Bad, and Going Out of My Head - Little Anthony & the Imperials<br />Since I Fell for You - Lenny Welch<br />Tossing and Turning - Bobby Lewis<br />Mr. Blue and Come Softly to Me - Fleetwoods<br />Remember Then and I Believe - Larry Chance and the Earls<br />Daddy's Home - Shep and the Limelighters<br />This Magic Moment and Cara Mia - Jay Black and the Americans<br />He Don't Love You (Like I Love You) - Jerry Butler and Pure Gold<br />Stagger Lee - Lloyd Price<br />Once in a While -  Chimes<br />Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye - Casinos<br />To the Aisle and In the Still of the Night - Fred Parris and the Satins<br />Let's Hang On - Frankie Valli and cast (end credits)<br />Bonus tracks (can be viewed in any order):<br />Never - Earls<br />My Own True Love -  Duprees<br />Come a Little Bit Closer - Jay Black and the Americans<br />First I Look at the Purse - Contours.
B00006HAXW///AXMKAXC0TR9AW///C. W. Emblom "Bill Emblom"///5/6///5.0///1082592000///Outstanding Whether It Is Either On VHS Or DVD///I own both the VHS and DVD versions of this program, and I second everything the other reviewer wrote.  I used most of these songs in my after school music class with 5th and 6th graders and they love it.  We first sang the songs off lyric sheets and from CD's and then watched the DVD.  They enjoyed it so much I ordered a DVD copy for each of my students as a present for joining the class.  I would suggest ordering the DVD version since it has about eight interviews with artists from the program in addition to six extra songs that aren't available on the VHS version.  The DVD version is now available only from PBS.  The singers may be older than when they first made these songs hits, but they can still sing them as well as ever.  My only complaint with it is it has five songs by Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Two would have been enough with maybe a second song from some of the other singers in their place.  Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with either the VHS or DVD version.  I prefer the DVD since it includes extra songs and interviews that the VHS version doesn't have.

I own a yellow lab(2) and I can tell you this is a pretty realistic. Yes I guess the critics would like to see a gloom and doom ending but I dont think they heard of the true story of when one of these trmendously faithful conpanions carried his master half a mile back to his home after he suffered a near fatal heart attack(would have been fatal if not for yellows actions). It is a very heartwarming  story without being predictable and just fantastic views. The heck with critics. Buy this because it makes you feel good and that there wasnt a need for explosions or car chases or guns to provide for interesting viewing.
B00004CQT3///A1CIW2OEVAJRM2///Godly Gadfly///14/15///5.0///1092441600///Spectacular and suspenseful family film!///The cover of our DVD of "Far From Home" says in large letters: "Family Feature".  And a great family movie it is.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that this is just another dog movie, in this case the adventures of a Labrador named "Yellow".  Even more it is about the adventures of his young master Angus.  Angus acquires Yellow when the dog appears on the family property, apparently lost, and soon the boy and his dog become firm friends.  When Angus and Yellow are marooned in wilderness country after the sinking of his father's ship, it is their combined strength that is required to survive the rugged coastline, vast forests, and hostile wildlife.<br /><br />Most of the conflict revolves around this very real struggle against the elements, leading up to a suspenseful and heartwarming conclusion.  But along with this suspense comes excellent and convincing characterization.  More than just an adventure story, "Far From Home" is ultimately a coming-of-age story, as Angus learns about responsibility and survival.  In the process, his relationships with his father and with his dog are especially well-portrayed.<br /><br />Although the movie is "clean", I would not recommend this movie for younger children under 10 mainly because of its capacity to evoke strong emotions of fear (there are some scary moments involving a sinking ship during a storm, a wolf attack, and a perilous log crossing over a ravine) and grief (it's hard to hold back the emotions experienced at losing a missing child).  But with this depth of emotion, older children and adults alike will find it a real tear-jerker.  When combined with good acting and some lovely cinematography of beautiful rugged British Columbia, this movie is definitely a drama worth keeping for the family. - GODLY GADFLY
B00004CQT3///A1VJCDRXUQVXBM///K. Kangley///10/11///5.0///964915200///A truly wonderful family film///I would beg to differ with the above description of the film. This is not the typical &quot;A-boy-and-his-pet&quot; film. The story is more realistic than the typical film of its genre such as &quot;Flipper&quot; or  &quot;Lassie&quot; and lacks the obvious manipulations of an &quot;Air  Bud.&quot; The characters look like real people. (Watch how Angus' little  brother dresses himself. Anyone who has been around a six-year old can see  their child dressing like this). Angus's and Yellow's fight through the  wilderness is not glossed over or &quot;Disneyfied.&quot; The  cinematography is beautiful. This film is wonderful for the whole family,  not just for the six-year old.
B00004CQT3///A2IMLPUXYQJTSY///Jerry Loveless "jerryl3515"///7/7///5.0///1146960000///Excellent Family Movie///As owners of a Yellow Lab, we just might be a bit biased, but we were mesmerized by this movie.<br /><br />The adventures of a lost boy and dog.  Of course the ending is predictable.  We knew that.  But the story line, the fabulous scenery, the cinematography, the acting, the sub-plots and the adventure make this a must-see movie for the whole family - Preview it before showing it to the very young; they might be traumatized by the scary parts.<br /><br />Buy "Far From Home..."  a guaranteed winner.  You'll be watching it over and over again.
B00004CQT3///A1D12NAC1U12F0///Frank J. Pickens "Blade"///4/4///5.0///1154304000///Awesome Dog Movie///You don't have to own a Yellow Lab to absolutley love this movie, but true dog lovers will find it irrestible. A young boy takes in a lost Yellow lab, and despite his parents reservations allow him to keep the dog. The boy and the dog become very close and forge a bond that is put to the test when they are lost in boat accident and end up stranded on a remote island. The dog stays by the young boy's side as they struggle to survive, find food, and battle a pack of wolves. All this happens while his parents and the coast guard desperately search for him.<br /><br /> After many weeks pass the Coast Guard believes they may never be found, but the dog and the boy do survive as they gain strength through each others love and devotion. It has an unusual ending, which I don't want to spoil, but Yellow Dog is one movie, although simple in structure, that really captures the true relationship that a boy and a dog can have that transcends even human friendships.
B00004CQT3///A3RVH9HUN9J4LZ///Michael///1/1///5.0///1248825600///A movie for all ages///You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this film.  This is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy.  It has something for everyone.  Lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this coming-of-age wilderness drama.  A few scary moments for the young ones, but nothing they can't handle.  A few sprinkles of romance.  Lots of dog-boy bonding.  The ending is predictable for all but the very young, but delightful nonetheless.  Best of all, it's just a delightful movie free of violence, car chases, shoot-outs and antagonists!  This movie was engaging from start to finish.  On par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V3A">The Journey of Natty Gann</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ZXSI">A Walk in the Clouds</a>.

B00004CQT3///A2582KMXLK2P06///B. E Jackson///0/0///3.0///1323043200///uh oh///I'm sorry to be such a Scrooge with Christmas rapidly approaching, but while watching Far From Home- The Adventures of Yellow Dog tonight, it sort of struck me as boring.  I was expecting a family-oriented film that focuses on a teenager and his dog struggling to make it after a terrible boat accident leaves them stranded along the rocky coasts of British Columbia, and the film delivers in that respect but... it just *barely* delivers.<br /><br />The entire presentation feels really bloated and exaggerated to me which is typical of early to mid 90's adventure films.  A film that certainly LOOKS really good and I imagine a lot of time was devoted to making it, and I remember back in the mid 90's how these type of animal movies won the hearts of everyone who had an affection for them, but as the years pass and technology and filmmaking changes, I find a movie like this just isn't very fun to watch anymore.<br /><br />I can't remember if this film was produce by Disney but it definitely *feels* like it was.  My biggest problem is that the actual survival story between the teenager and his dog was incredibly shallow.<br /><br />Yes they collect bugs, kill animals when they get hungry enough, encounter dangerous wildlife animals such as wolves and wild cats, but... it's just not enough.  These segments feel undeveloped and uncreative.  It's just not enough entertainment and doesn't offer a darn thing as far as originality is concerned either.  It's completely missing anything TRULY enticing.<br /><br />Yes, the parents are worried that their teenage boy is missing.  Interesting though that it never seemed to cross the mind of either those searching for the boy or his parents (with the exception of one scene) that he might be dead.  It was also strange how it was just assumed the boy would make it on land.  I'd be flying planes over the ocean first.<br /><br />If that was MY son out there missing in the woods, you better believe I'd fear the worst.  Granted, there was one really good emotional segment where the father looks into a mirror and cries his eyes out while his wife comforts him, but eh... that was just one moment of sincerity surrounded by a subtle belief that the boys life was never *truly* in danger.  Not very appealing or accurate storytelling.<br /><br />The fact the film is barely 75 minutes long is another problem, and even though everyone loves the dramatic and touching ending, I've seen better.  Actually had the entire movie been dramatic and memorable like the ending, it would have been even better.<br /><br />Personally I feel Homeward Bound is a LOT better because that movie utilizes not just a compelling story of animal survival, but humor as well.  A much better movie than this one.

Then Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog, is the movie for you! This movie tells the story of a young boy named Angus who adopts a stray dog and names him Yellow. Angus, his father, and Yellow set sail one day, but a huge storm causes their boat to topple. Rescue teams are only able to find Angus' father. Stranded on an island far from civilization, Angus and Yellow's survival skills are put to the test. Will they get rescued? Watch this movie to find out! I liked this movie because it is a heartwarming tale. The movie builds anticipation in the rescue team's pursuit to find Angus and Yellow. I was especially impressed with Yellow's acting! His facial expressions and actions resemble that of a person's. I recommend this film for children ages 7 and up. The movie is an uplifting journey and is a splendid family film. Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog is one of the many classics brought to your home by HDnet movies on KidScene, a morning and Friday night programming block specifically for kids and families.

B00004CQT3///A8DDTUL8OWFMO///LuAnn Perkins///0/0///5.0///1301443200///Family Movie///A refreshing, family movie!  A dog finds a boy, boy keeps dog only if he takes complete care of him.  Dog, he names Yellow, becomes boys best friend.  A functional family teaching their son responsibility.  The scenery in this movie is beautiful. You will laugh, smile, and have tears....ending with joy.  Years ago we purchased this movie for ourselves after seeing it on HBO.  We have since purchased it for adults and for children.
B00004CQT3///A174WE983H06N4///ZombiBoi///0/0///5.0///1298937600///Family entertainment that's not just for the kids///The first time I viewed this film I was a young teen. Now as a 29 year old guy I find this film just as entertaining as I did all those years ago. In a nutshell this is a film about a boy and the dog who found him,changed him,and saved his life when they were both shipwrecked. This film will appeal to anyone from 5 to 95 who enjoy clean adventurous family films.

B00004CQT3///A2I6MHMAZZDCRX///Mark Baker///0/0///3.0///1222819200///A Boy and His Dog Fight to Survive///Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, young Angus McCormick (Jesse Bradford) has learned many survival skills.  He's just finishing up a nice canoe.  And when he finds a stray dog, he adopts him and names him Yellow.<br /><br />Taking a few days off from school to accompany his dad, John (Bruce Davison), on a supply run seems like a dream come true.  But when they encounter a fierce storm, the boat they are in capsizes.  John is quickly rescued, but the search and rescue teams can't find any trace of Angus or Yellow.<br /><br />The two have survives and are trying to find their way back to civilization.  Will they be able to survive and be reunited with their family?<br /><br />This movie is fairly standard and innocuous family fare.  It is a little slow at times, especially in the beginning while things are set up.  It is fairly predictable.  But it is entertaining.  Kids will enjoy it more than their parents.  My biggest complaint was actually the short scenes.  Many things are introduced and resolved too quickly, never giving any plot point time to be fully developed.  At the same time, I did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfying.<br /><br />The film could have been much better but does grow on you.  Don't rush out to see it, but there's no reason to avoid it either.

Syrett "grandma-vicki"///3/5///5.0///997315200///Far From Home: Adventures of Yellow Dog///I disagree with the reviewers who said the movie was predictable and drawn out.  It was a movie with heart and you could feel the main characters plight when he lost his companion.  Being an animal lover I was pulling for the happy ending (of Course).  I am Disney's biggest fan and I love this movie right along with the others. (P.S.  I am a Grandmother to eleven.)  Thank heavens for Disney Movies.
B00004CQT3///A11L5M4MJP00UW///David L Hutchins "Music Lover"///2/6///3.0///1168473600///Disappointing///I love dogs and I really wanted to love this film.  Unfortunately I didn't find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but perhaps I didn't find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this.  Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds.  Also it seemed that they didn't spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog. (The movie is short; not even 1 1/2 hours.) It's a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring.  The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog can't be rescued, but don't worry as it has a happy ending.  It's an okay movie, but I expected a lot more.  I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy (like Shrek II).  This is definately one mainly just for the kids.  So many things that kids can't or shouldn't watch.  This is one that anyone can watch, which is a big plus.  Probably would have been better as a TV movie and would easily fit in a 2-hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials.
B00004CQT3///A2VDM3D712BGLE///Elizabeth LaRosa///1/5///1.0///1262304000///Truly bad but not the worst///This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. The acting wasn't good, it was very predictable, and some parts of the plot were competly unnecessary. The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home, his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy. If you want predictable, watch a survival movie. What happens, almost always, is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident, they struggle to survive, they are found, and then brought home. "Far From Home" is no exception. As for unnecessary, the whole "romance" part of this movie was badly done and not needed. The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home, and all the while, the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse. Also some parts of this movie might upset young children, such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow can't be rescued. All in all, I would not advise anyone to see this movie; in fact, I would warn against it.
B00004CQT4///A1NN07FHTQZZ6K///Michele Adams///0/0///5.0///1252195200///Who's the man///It is a funny movie, but I think there is way too much cursing, it takes away from the movie....

Plus, Dennis Leary is great and "Duff" from MTV (VJ around 1990-91) also makes a cameo.....very cute! I would recommend this movie for anyone that was a young adult around 1993 or to someone who wants a good laugh.<br /><br />MJ

Dr. Dre and Ed Lover are a great pair, very funny.  Dennis Leary is hysterical.  So many quotable quotes!  The parade of rap stars actually enhances the movie. It's not a serious movie, more like really long funny skit.

A hidden gem.
B0078V2LCY///A27H9DOUGY9FOS///K. Harris "Film aficionado"///1/1///3.0///1327968000///A Lavish Chinese Production That Ends Up Being A Soapy (And Pretty Loopy) Revenge Drama///I had heard a lot of criticism leveled at Gao Xiaosong's "My Kingdom" complaining that its two disparate halves never really fit together into a cohesive narrative. The first part of the film strains for epic grandeur with its story of two orphans being trained in the art and honor of the Chinese opera (not the singing kind). One of the boys sees his family slaughtered in a political maneuver but is saved from imminent death by a wandering opera master and his charge. The three form a offbeat family unit which is threatened when their master is humiliated in a challenge with a Southern rival. The movie fast forwards until the boys are grown and ready to seek a form of retribution as they move into the popular Shanghai opera scene in the twenties. After this simple story is resolved, the second half of the film becomes a loopy bit of revenge fantasy. The screenplay twists and turns as secrets are revealed, implausibilities mount up, and characters have their ulterior motives exposed. It is chaotic (and tries way too hard), but at least it's fun.<br /><br />Many who have unfavorably judged "My Kingdom" tend to proclaim the first half as brilliant and the second half as the weak link. I, however, tend to disagree. I thought that the introductory premise was so thin and contrived that I never bought into the dramatic substance of the plot. Heck, two seconds after the boys arrive in Shanghai, they are greeted by a street parade extolling an upcoming performance of the man who bested their adoptive father 15 years previously. Hey, that was simple. These two vagabonds issue a challenge to the opera superstar that somehow gets newspaper coverage and makes them headliners in a opera duel. Hey, that was simple too. Now they are legends! Wow, that's a lot for their first day in town! After the duel, the boys must integrate themselves within the existing opera company that includes a defiant leading lady. As one steps into the spotlight and an illicit affair, the other seeks to avenge his family's murder from so many years ago. The remainder of the film plays as a twisty thriller that never feels particularly real. But as the convoluted plotting wraps around itself, I must admit to being amused by it all. It, for me, was far more entertaining than what had preceded it.<br /><br />The movie itself is elaborately staged. The battle sequences and opera numbers have a pleasing over-the-top quality. 1920's Shanghai is lush and gorgeous and the costuming is memorable. However, it all feels a little flat. The leads are attractive enough, but they lack a gravitas to convince us they can headline an intended epic. I understand they are known pop stars in their country, and that makes sense. The actor who plays a diabolical police investigator seems like he's about twelve and downplays the drama out of every scene. Ultimately, I think "My Kingdom" tries to accomplish too much. I personally wish they would have committed to making it an adult soap opera with no pretensions other than to entertain. As is, it's a bit of a mess. I probably liked it for the wrong reasons, but its loopiness is not without its charms. KGHarris, 1/12.

The only downside of the show was it only lasted two seasons.  I already bought the show in HD via Xbox Live.  Glad to see it on Amazon.com VOD.  I would have bought from here first if it was available at the time.  Wish show would come out on Blu-ray.  Season 2 even got better when the guys move out and get their own apartment.  Kevin Smith directed the pilot episode. Enjoy.
B004BH1TN0///AWPODHOB4GFWL///Martin A Hogan "Marty From SF"///34/35///5.0///1012003200///As Crisp As A Live Recording Can Be///Recording with an audience of less than 1,000, this DVD feels like a club recording with it's Dolby Ditigal and DTS audio sound.  Host Mark McEwen gushes a tad much and the 'Live by Request' gimmick is not original.  Still, it manages to captivate.  Fifteen songs (one a medley of eight), five being from the last album, it's a collection that defies the ear with the groups tight instrumentals and harmonies.  &quot;She Keep On Coming&quot; and &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot; rock the house, while &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; and &quot;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart&quot; lull the audience into a trance.  This recording is unique in that there are plenty of star 'call-ins' and lots of joking around.  Its surprising to hear Barry sing, &quot;Woman In Love&quot;, but &quot;Nights On Broadway&quot; is, once again, cut far too short for a song that contains some of their best work.<p>This is as close as a great live recording gets and a DVD well worth owning.  &quot;One Night Only&quot; is a great live recording as well, but nothing matches the intimacy of this presentation.
B004BH1TN0///A1R6DF0KOJ0TG6///Rona///2/2///5.0///1043712000///Bee Gees - Live by Request///This is an awesome concert because the Bee Gees are so relaxed and spontaneous!  It was even fun listening to the request call-ins.  Some of the women said the same things I would have said if I had been able to view it live.  Love those guys!! Also, they performed songs that are not in some of their other recorded concerts.  I highly recommend this DVD!

They sound just as good (or better) as when they were younger--I play one after the other at times (there are a few new songs on "This Is Where I Came In") on my stereo, set for DTS--ohhhh the sound is INCREDIBLE!!  I catch myself "boogie-ing"(not sure how to spell that--sorry) constantly...I'm 31 years old & LOVE the Bee Gees!!  What more can I say? :)

As African Americans our (my family) taste in music is culturally diverse and the Bee Gees are on the top of our lists.  This concert is a definite must see ranking right up there with their "One Night Only" concert.  Several songs on this DVD I've never heard before but they have become my favorites. The Bee Gees were very playful/silly/funny in this concert which was a treat to see that different aspect of the group.
B004BH1TN0///A2WFI5XFB7NHHJ///M. Chung "music lover"///0/0///4.0///1168819200///bee gees fans enjoy///This is a fine performance by the Bee Gees who perform "by request", probably the most difficult format for live performers.  They play most of their songs and most fans might complain about various hits that were omitted.  Still an enjoyable performance.
B004BH1TN0///AUQW6UEZFC7B2///Country Woman///0/0///5.0///1051228800///Wonderful!///I have been a Bee Gees fan for years.  It is really wonderful to see them again.  I love the songs from the new album &quot;This is Where I In&quot;.  It is really great to hear Maurice take the lead in two of the songs, &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking on Air&quot;.  While Barry and Robin have beautiful voices, I really enjoy listening to Maurice sing. After all these years, it is really great to see and hear the joy they still get from their music and from preforming together.<br />While precious minutes of the show were taken up with requests, it was still nice to see their interaction with the fans.  I think anyone who is a fan of Barry, Robin and Maurice will enjoy this video.  I have watched it over and over.  It is really sad that we won't have the chance to see the three of them together like this again.
B0071AD95K///AA72A0AYTWV5Y///fjiewofjeiwo///5/5///5.0///1283299200///HOPE///Although this movie is broke up into two different parts, it was very good.  Since the movie was done in two parts, the second one repeats a lot as if one was not there to view the first part.  I did not like that at all.  The point to this movie is really good.  I'm actually going to send it to someone that has held "life" against God.  This is an excellent ministering tool!!
B0071AD95K///A13NO1WIGJZUV4///J. A. Handford///4/4///5.0///1295136000///Finding Hope in the face of loss///This DVD was very helpful for those who had lost a loved one in our family of faith. It was able to show that we are not alone in our loss or pain and that while our loved ones are gone from here --- they are still with us in spirit. It made our faith stronger and brought our family closer together in God's love. Louie Giglio is a Christian who's spirit sends a loving message from his heart.
B0071AD95K///AOIT2QUH8GRGA///Ryan's mom///3/3///5.0///1288569600///Very inspiring!  Great for teenagers and young adults.///The whole Passion Series is life changing, a must have for any Christian household that has teenagers and young adults.  Louie has wonderful approach to teaching about the magnificence of God, the Creater of Heaven and Earth!  My  16 year old niece was so impressed and awe-struck after viewing "How Great is Our God" and "Indescribable" that she ended up taking the whole series home with her to share with all her friends.  Needless to say, I let her keep them and purchased a new series for myself. I am going to be showing my Bible study group "How Great is Our God" tonight as we have a skeptic in our group.  I know this video will dispel any doubts she may have about God!  The "Hope" video is equally inspiring in a different way, more focused on real life rather than creation.  It is a compliment to the "Fruitcake and Ice Cream" video which deals with a real life story of a young college student who comes to know Christ.
B0071AD95K///A2D595HNMO9PHR///Stephen///1/1///5.0///1287187200///Exceptional///This is an amazing video for those who are suffering. When life hurts most, when the bottom falls out, when tragedy strikes I need to know, "Is there still hope for me?" Louie answers a resounding YES. He explores the topic of suffering better than anyone I've heard. I was deeply inspired by this two-part video series. I recommend you buy it if you're hurting.
B0071AD95K///A3ENN12GLNTUAF///J. Kennel "marriagefanatic"///1/1///5.0///1274745600///Terrific DVD for anyone suffering///This DVD is the third in the Passion 2006 series done by Louie Giglio.  The four videos go in order, so it is helpful to see them in order to follow the story throughout all of them.  However, having said that, this is still a very moving presentation about pain, suffering, and hope.  I would recommend this for high school and older, for Christians and non-Christians.<br /><br />You can watch this with someone who is suffering, and no one has to say a word at the end.  It is not intrusive or offensive, but is comforting because it is about the God who is truly big enough to comfort anyone in the worst circumstances in life.  And everyone experiences them at some point.  With this Hope presentation, and with all of them in the series, you definitely will sense that God does the supernatural "heavy lifting" that no human possibly can.<br /><br />Excellent for mentoring teens and older.  The audience in the video is largely college age.  Highly recommended!
B0071AD95K///A2OKCS5234ZV7S///Flower///4/6///5.0///1267401600///Wow.............///This is an awesome addition to your movie collection!... A great tool to use to witness to others. All four are great and I think that you need all four. We own all four and even our children are interested in the series. They even repeat things that are stated in the serious. We are all amazed at the topics and images. You will have to see this for yourself. If you have viewed any of the others, Hope is a must view as well. There really are not any words to describe the experience of viewing Hope. Also there is no statement that can tell you the experience of owning all four to share with others. You never know when you may encounter someone who may need what is in this series and you to can use this series to win souls, and bring someone out of the darkness and into the light.<br /><br />Our souls have truly been blessed by this series... we plan to bless others when they visit us with this series. Go ahead and Bless yourself, family, and friends with this awesome series, make sure you get all four and view them all. We tried to view them in the order that they are listed inside of the dvd. I don't know if it matters, as it is just what we did. Now we are waiting on the Blind side to come out.. Enjoy! You won't be the same! A treat for the whole family, friends, church family, and the neighborhood! Don't forget the popcorn! We use the crazy popcorn popper it is awesome with movies or without!<br /><br />This is one series that we are glad we did not pass by... all cultures will and should enjoy this!<br /><br />Always watch what you do and say to others as you never know what they are going through, or the impact you will have on them, and you never know who you are entertaining.<br /><br />Keep up the Good Work Louie Giglio!

B000063W1R///A2M2O1DI1SCQDI///Mimi///1/1///5.0///1344816000///The Count of Monte Cristo (Blu-ray)///Great Blu-ray DVD for the price!  The graphic and sound quality is excellent.  The product was received less than 7 days and was well packaged.
B000063W1R///A2IOMS4TK2QSFW///Holly N.///1/1///4.0///1331769600///Revenge, served by Jim Cavizel///I love this movie! Sure, the acting isn't oscar worthy, but the characters are interesting in this classic story. It also helps that Jim Caviezel is smoking HOT in this remake of Dumas' famous story.
B000063W1R///A2YWH9COGWT8VU///ECastle///1/1///5.0///1331510400///Better than the book///I love to read and am normally disappointed in the movies which are based on those books. This is the exception. Great, believable characters. Excellent character development. And some sword play and action to keep the men in your life interested.
B000063W1R///A3QIEISBZP4QTV///Mark E. Baxter "Inquirer"///1/1///5.0///1320278400///One of the best adventure movies ever///Start with great material like the classic book this film is based on, use a great director, pick great locations, assemble an incredible cast mixing well known with newer actors, and then adapt the book in a brilliant screenplay, and you end up with a movie like this that is everything a movie should be.  Adventure, mystery, romance, action sequences, character and plot development, and humor are all combined into a masterpiece.<br /><br />The 1,000 page book by Dumas is, of course, a beloved classic with the theme of what would perfect revenge be like.  The book has complicated twists and a darker tone with an ending that feels like a let down in many ways.  Incredibly, the screenplay manages to summarize the book and include enough adaptations and a much more positive ending.  I can't say enough good about this screenplay and how well this movie adapts an intricate novel that would be impossible to film if you kept strictly to the plot of the novel.  The screenplay is perfectly balanced.  If you have watched several current adventure movies where the lighting is so dark, the action so blurred, the characters so poorly developed, and the plot so weak that you aren't even sure who you are watching and why they are doing whatever it is they are doing on the screen, you will appreciate the pacing of this film with clear lighting and a sound track that even grandfather can understand.<br /><br />The acting is perfect with no grandiloquent flourishes but enough idiosyncracy that each character seems perfectly drawn.  Caviezel just couldn't be better as the lead character Dantes who is betrayed by his best friend who marries his girlfriend and sends him to prison for life.  Dantes meets a wise prisoner with knowledge of a hidden fortune, played by the late Richard Harris, and eventually escapes and wreaks a carefully plotted revenge on each and every enemy who had wronged him.<br /><br />Without giving any more of the plot away, let me just say that this is the way movies should be and that the whole family will love this movie and watch it again and again as mine has.<br /><br />Available in several formats, and for a great price since this movie has been out for nearly 10 years, I definitely recommend this movie highly.  Five stars.
B000063W1R///A17RUD7RKGZUA4///PINKPEARL///1/1///5.0///1300147200///AWESOME///I have to say I was so impressed with this movie.  It is a great movie, and though not a Christian movie, it has a lot of God themes mingled in between.  I highly recommend this movie.  I am buying 2 other to give away.  SEE it, you will not be disappointed.
B000063W1R///A18758S1PUYIDT///Viva///1/1///4.0///1288051200///A tale of revenge, love, adventure, and endurance///I should have read the book by now!  That's what I was thinking as I was halfway through this particular version--the only movie version I've seen so far.  The cast is okay, though I think the woman playing Mercedes needed to do a better job of enunciating.  The hellhole of the prison was portrayed effectively, and I totally understand Dantes' (sp?) desire for revenge, although he does learn eventually that living just to get even is not the ideal way to live after all.
B000063W1R///A2UFG3DMVELP6I///Arturo Bustamante "Art"///1/1///5.0///1275264000///Good///The movie was great I like it I actually ordered as a gift I already own it.  The price was good and so was the delivery.  Happy with the order.
B000063W1R///A4FBBS25X3XEL///M. Pruitt///1/1///5.0///1249344000///An all around great movie!///The Count Of Monte Cristo is an all around great movie. You have an excellent story line and plot. You get action, suspense, romance and even a couple of laughs. All this in a movie without nudity, sex or bad language. There is violence, but not in the excessive, graphic way we have come to expect from Hollywood. This movie is proof positive that you don't have to have explicit sex, language or blood and guts to have a great movie! I highly recommend it.
B000063W1R///A23Q1T4MXZHFM7///susumu-5///1/1///3.0///1244937600///Monte Cristo in 2 Hour Film?///The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is an over-1200-page voluminous novel. How could this super-long drama be fit into two hours? This film did that misson-impossible task. Compared with French TV-series starring Gerald Depardieu as the Count of Monte Cristo, first half of the story is well depicted, while the latter part is too brief. There is no Valentine nearly poisoned by her step mother, no Haydee, former Turk princess. And the story depends too much on duels so it is more visually described than the original story's deliberate revenge plan. But the relief is that Albert's role is spared and is given a huge part in this drama.<br /><br />Verdict: Monte Cristo for Young Adults<br />Rating: 70 out of 100. For shorter adaptation it is good.<br />Recommended for: Historical action movie fans and Three Musketeers appreciators.
B000063W1R///ANZNLFBN62YKH///James D'arcy Pacita D'arcy///1/1///5.0///1237334400///The best version of the Count of Monte Cristo I have seen///Richard Harris and Guy  Pearce made this movie great. All of the actors were superb and I think that the actual Chateau D'If was used. Superb in every way except not long enough.
B000063W1R///A2FX6OHBMQ9545///S. AIKEN///1/1///4.0///1236729600///better than previous adapations///The Count of Monte Cristo is a promising film, not as good as the original novel, but if it promises to get some interested in reading the book by Dumas, than it is worth watching.<br /><br />Richard Harris is always a pleasure to watch when he plays of character of Education or Tutoring.
B000063W1R///A1MIFONBFK8OWE///Casey Scott///1/1///4.0///1236038400///Great rainy day movie///Sit back and enjoy the interesting and exciting story of the Count Of Monte Cristo. Great rainy day movie!

I enjoyed the movie so much that I have started to read the book.  A classic book and great movie. Revenge is so well portrayed in this movie.  Vengence, honor, love, justice.  So good!<br /><br />This is my favorite movie to date!
B000063W1R///A19O5ETNRJN39D///D. Myers///1/1///5.0///1232064000///spell-binding///I am not a movie fan.  I find it difficult to sit and watch a story for 2 hours (and nearly impossible to 'suspend disbelief').  I will not pretend to write a clinical analysis of movie-making.  I will simply say I have seen this movie twice (and plan to see it again, nearly unheard of in my case) and both times was fully enveloped in this fascinating, beautifully told story.  That editing and departure from the novel occurred in some points is no surprise (just 2 hours), but the essence of the story remains, the victory of good over evil.  Tremendous movie.
B000063W1R///AMEJTGF5NQLNH///M. Miller///1/1///3.0///1227916800///The Passion of Monte Cristo///We must allow James Caviezel to be very good at being lashed- I believe, in fact, it was that aspect of this very performance that landed him the role of Jesus in Passion of the Christ. Besides that, he makes a pretty face, along with Guy Pearce, although somehow Pearce seems ESPECIALLY short in this film. Anyways, the acting is so-so, Caviezel plays Dantes as a whiny little brat, Guy Pearce acts like an evil gremlin, and the end ends happily as hollywood must, tho it makes the story more lame. The one reason to watch: Michael Wincott is excellent and deliciously evil as the prison warden for the Chateau D'if
B000063W1R///A1DDVFGUC6NQD3///M. Gibson///1/1///5.0///1221264000///This movie had a story///So much better than any movie I have seen lately.  I had never read the book or seen the movie and I just loved it.  It captured my imagination and the acting was so believable.  Jim C. was the Count.  I want to see it again and again.
B000063W1R///A36SSF310LBGSE///freedom78///1/1///3.0///1205020800///Good...but lacking.///I hate to give this film three stars. Or, rather, I hate that a film based on the book of the same title is worthy of only three stars. In most cases, I do my best to separate my opinions about a piece of literature, on one hand, and a film based on that literature, on the other. And there's no question that this film adequately and entertainingly captures the tale of revenge. What it lacks is the intricacy of Dumas's work, which really captures the meticulous planning and plotting that go into the protagonist's desire for vengeance. I cannot fault the film too much, as the level of detail required might have made this 2 hr. film much, much longer, which can be a fault, unto itself. I do recommend this movie, and for those who find it compelling, I give a far greater recommendation to the book.
B000063W1R///A63FDY7VFOMQV///J. Thomas///1/1///5.0///1198972800///Love this movie but hard to find in stores///This is a wonderful movie. I bought this for my Mom she just loves it! The process was extreamly fast and hastle free at Amazon.

There's some time spent in France and then it's around the world in a tale that makes me shiver even now.  Although the book of the same title by Alexander Dumus was where they got the name and stuff the story does come out a little better than the book in more ways than one.  This is not an easy story to put on the silver screen and I think personally this version is the first one you should see.  Boy has girl, boy has a friend, boy has his dreams come true... boy doing there... who me Tarzan?<br /><br />While this movie adeptly manages to come off new and exiting in it's production it still manages to fit in to the scheme of things from Hollywood and even to this day.<br /><br />Splendid acting by the cast and each stands out as if personally involved in the whole idea of the thing.<br />The sets are over the top.  There are some mansions and country-estates that make my mouth water even if because of the scene requiring dimly lit rooms.
B000063W1R///A2IT3899H776LW///AVA VAN "Caveziel fan"///1/1///5.0///1198540800///In my top 10 great movies///ACTION,ADVENTURE, INTRIGE, ROMANCE this movie has it all.This is<br />Jim's finest film...he was better in this than the PASSION OF THE CHRIST.<br />I have never read the book, but, I probably will now.  There is no relaxing in this movie has it has a lot of twists. I am amazed that the casting Director could take 3 unknowns and cast them perfectly.  In addition, the young man that played Jim's son must be his brother, cousin,etc in real life because he looks just like him.<br />The end is a little predicatable but very satisfying.
B000063W1R///A3NWP0SFAC0ZD2///K. Wells///1/1///5.0///1196121600///Superb Acting and Action!///A very well-done film and an excellent cast.  I'd put it right up with the Three and Four Musketeers movies (York, Reed, Chamberlain, Heston, etc).

I can't tell you how many times I have watched this movie and still enjoy watching it again. The acting is surperb and the quality of the story is deep, entertaining, and thought provoking. An awesome buy and the purpose of owning is to watch it and watch it again and again if not why not just rent.
B000063W1R///A3VP6XR88INLRB///M. J. McManus///1/1///4.0///1189641600///Great "sleeper" movie///This is a great movie.  That many people don't know about.  Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce do great acting.  I think after Guy Pearce's performance, I won't like him if I ever meet him in real life.  He makes his character so dis likable.  Which is the point!
B000063W1R///A355WMP0CQBJFX///horrorqueen///1/1///5.0///1189641600///A MOVIE THAT MEETS THE STANDARDS OF THE BOOK!!///this movie is incredible. very captivating from beginning to end. sensational movie, very well done, and played out. truly stands up to the book, which was beautifully written. a bit of difference, but came out well enough to be a success. the count of monte cristo has so much in it. a young man, innocent, trusting, and in love losses it all in a second because of his suppose friends jelousy. all is taken and all hope seems lost, until he meets a friend, meanwhile his anger and vengance grow. he returns to a whole different world. his only thought is revenge, but so many twists and turns he doesn't even expect what happens to happen. this has innocence, betrayel, cruelty, hardship, vengance, love, and friendship all in one. beautiful story, a hard era, and excellent film. the actors were superb. jim caviezel, a wonderful actor. there's just something about him that makes him very interesting to watch. those eyes just draw you in and his talent, makes him great. he was spectacular in this film. guy pearce, shined his on his own behalf. did it so well that you actually hated him in this movie. all of the actors were great, made it so dramatic, it was believable. nicely done.

B000063W1R///ATQDMCZ904Y4W///Anna B.///1/1///5.0///1016755200///An unexpected treat///The Count of Monte Cristo was one of my most favorite novels during my teenage years. I was skeptical of its yet another remake but decided to give it a try. However, both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to find a well-directed movie with superior acting by James Caviezel. He's done a splendid job by portraying first the innocence of happy youth and then becoming the embodiment of righteous, yet calculated revenge. I also really enjoyed the fact that the leading characters were not cast by the "bigger" names. Save your time and money -skip Moulin Rouge and see this great movie! In my opinion, it deserves more attention and praise from critics and the media than it has gotten so far.
B000063W1R///A1IJINKEDO8E8A///M.

I could not take my eyes off of the movie and spent the next 2 hours enthralled.<br /><br />if you are wondering whether this is worth the money.....spend it, you'll definately be happy you did.
B000063W1R///AQ8DU6XVA3USJ///Alejandra Vernon "artist & illustrator"///3/4///5.0///1085011200///&quot;you must look into that storm&quot;///Based on the Dumas story, this fabulous adventure about a naive, illiterate young man in 19th century France whose fate embroils him in treachery and vengeance, is well written with wit and intelligence, and abridges a complex plot into a cohesive 131 minute film.<br />The location cinematography in Malta and Ireland is spectacular, though my one and only complaint about this film is that occasionally some of the indoor sequences tend to be a little murky.<br />The soundtrack by Edward Shearmur is also top-notch, and adds a lot to the film.<p>The cast:<br />Jim Caviezel brilliantly captures the essence of the Dantes/Count character; believable both as the innocent Edmund and the worldly Count of Monte Cristo, with his swashbuckling prowess and elegant style.<br />Richard Harris as the priest who mentor Dantes is marvelous; wily and wise, it's a perfect part for Harris, and he makes the most of it.<br />Other standout performances come from Guy Peerce as Fernand, Michael Wincott as Armand Dorelac, the Warden of d'If, and most of all, Luis Guzman as a very funny Jacopo.<p>This is terrific family viewing, free of the plague of foul language and heavy breathing between the sheets that have made films so tiresome in recent years. This film will feed your brain, delight your eyes, and raise your heartbeat a little with its fast-paced exploits about &quot;kings and pawns, emperors and fools&quot;.
B000063W1R///A1ICAVFAYAJDUP///"princesssilvia"///5/7///5.0///1037491200///Fabulous Entertainment!///This is, by far, the best rendition for the big screen of the novel by Dumas (although it's not 100% close to the book) and, by far, one of the best movies in recent years.<br />What other movie do you remember going to, where, at the end, while the titles scroll, a roar of applause comes from the audience? I've lended my DVD to a few skeptic friends and all not only liked the movie, they LOVED IT!<br />Wonderfully acted, with wonderful scenery, this movie truly deserves more credit that it has gotten. STARS hands down!

I enjoyed it then and I love it even more now.  The movie graphics are so much better than my imagination.  It has all of the essentials to satisfy both mine and my husbands movie expectations - romance, intrigue, sword fights, action. Definitely a movie to add to your collection.
B000063W1R///A3QEBUBAQHE4DI///blacketarani///2/3///4.0///1144800000///Excellent - if you don't want to watch Count of Monte Cristo.///Yes, it is called Count of Monte Cristo, but let's just say that the story bears little resemblance to the literature. Yes, Edmond Dantes is wrongly imprisoned and meets someone there that helps him get out and rain misfortunes down on those who were responsible for his time in the Chateau d'If. That's pretty much where the similarities end. The methods of revenge in the movie are much less imaginative, basically consisting of him telling them he is Dantes and then killing them. These replace Dumas' genius methods - economic ruin, mental insanity, suicide, etc.<br /><br />However, if you don't want to commit to reading a 1500 page book, and can't devise a way to see the play adaptation, you will never know the differences, and this is a good movie. Just take it on it's own merits rather than on the book's.
B000063W1R///A3AE7GKA6NF3ML///Tricecakes "La Trice"///2/3///5.0///1119312000///Our Family Rates This As One Of Our Favorite Movies!!!///This is one of our favorite movies.  We seldom like to see a movie more than twice.  However, this movie was so entertaining (as well as it contained excellent drama, acting, and a well developed plot), that we have viewed it numerous times.  My Teenage kids as well as my younger boys enjoyed the movie.  I did have to re-explain some moral issues & contradictions concerning the implied premarital sex and adultery.  We used the theme of revenge vs forgiveness as a discussion tool. It was also refreshing to see a movie with positive references to God and still be exciting.  We are going to read the book this summer, and We don't expect the book and the movie to be exactly the same.  They are two different expressions.
B000063W1R///A1FBZRYTAA6O1Z///Andrew Urquhart "Metal Guru"///2/3///5.0///1105920000///Amazing film - but with a couple of minor glitches///I'll admit, I've not read the original source novel on which this is based (the only thing by Dumas I have read, is the classic 'Musketeers'); life is too short to read every great novel, try as one might - but having seen this film, I am determined to seek out the text.<br /><br /> Judging the film on its own terms, I found this immensely satisfying, and though quite long (131 min), it does not drag for a second. The story itself is really quite something, and no matter how many films you have seen, or books you have read, you will be absolutely bowled over (as George Bernard Shaw was) by the breadth, depth, simplicity and universality of it.<br /><br /> There are some minor faults with the film; sometimes the dialogue seems a little stilted (eg. Guy Pearce, an Australian who has mastered a range of accents, seems a little too much of a cookie-cutter villain: Daniel Day-Lewis did a much better job in 'Gangs of New York'). There is something faintly unsatisying about the conclusion, no matter how memorable it may be - but even compared with 'Barry Lyndon' (Kubrick), this is still a riveting, assured adaptation.<br /><br /> These are very minor quibbles, and I would put this in with some of my favourite films, along with 'Captain Blood' (Errol Flynn), 'Koyanisquaatsi', 'New Cinema Paradiso' and 'Celebration' (aka Festen). Generally, the script is absolutely top notch, full of little throw-away quips and putdowns. The cast is absolutely stunning, especially James Calaziel, absolutely convincing in his metamorphosis from naive youth to cold-blooded avenger. Watch out for Luis Guizman as a scheming pirate.<br /><br /> Very highly recommended, for those who seek something a little more high-brow than the standard multiplex schlock.
B000063W1R///A2FEGRJQNU51P9///Joe Sherry///2/3///4.0///1082592000///a nice adaptation of Dumas's clasic novel///A film by Kevin Reynolds<p>This is the recent film adaptation of Dumas's classic novel "The Count of Monte Cristo".  From the previews and early reviews of the movie I did not expect too much from it, but when someone whose opinion I trust tells me that it is good and that I should watch it, I was willing to give it a chance.  Good thing, because this is a pretty good movie.  <p>The story, if you are not familiar with the source material, follows Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel).  Dantes, in the film, is a sailor and the film opens with Dantes and his friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pierce) trying find refuge on an island because their captain is dying.  The island just happens to be the prison island where Napoleon is exiled, and while they get help, Napoleon asks Dantes if he could take a personal, and innocent, letter to a friend.  Dantes agrees.  Dantes returns to France and does not have a chance to deliver the letter, though we do see his fianc&eacute; Mercedes Iguanada (Dagmara Dominczyk) and a little bit of Mondego's jealousy.  Dantes is betrayed and turned into the authorities for treason.  That innocent letter that Dantes was to deliver was not so innocent after all.  The magistrate has Dantes thrown in prison where he will spend the next several years.  <p>This is where the movie truly begins.  Dantes was innocent and he was betrayed (we soon learn that Mondego is now married to Mercedes), and he wants his revenge, though he has no avenue to pursue his revenge while in prison.  While in prison, Dantes meets Abbe Faria (Richard Harris), a man who is digging a tunnel (slowly, inch by inch) to escape.  Faria trains Dantes in the sword, teaches him how to read, science, literature, politics, and how to be a noble.  He also tells Dantes of a treasure, the treasure of Monte Cristo, that may or may not exist.  <p>We wouldn't have a story if Dantes is unable to escape or pursue his revenge, so I'm not spoiling anything by revealing that.  Dantes sets himself up as the Count of Monte Cristo with the help of a man named Jacopo (Luis Guzman).  Dantes is now free to pursue his revenge.  <p>The story feels like it has been simplified a little bit, but this film is good enough, and slick enough, and entertaining enough, that this is a very enjoyable movie to watch.  No film can ever capture the nuance of a novel, especially not a 1000 page novel.  With the amount of time allotted this film, "The Count of Monte Cristo" succeeds at being an entertaining film.
B000063W1R///A18XYPKYS15YBP///Lisa "southernbelle54"///2/3///3.0///1055116800///Great...until the ending///I read the 'Monte Cristo' book a few months before the movie came out and I adored it, so I was really pumped up to see it on screen. First off, the actors were perfectly casted and the director did a great job adapting the book to film. BUT,I have to take points off for the ending. Whenever a book is made into a movie, the plot is tweaked and molded to be more entertaining visually. My issue was not just that the ending was changed, it was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what happened in the book! It was totally ridiculous! It was exactly what you would expect to happen, even though it was totally unrealistic. That's why I gave it only three stars. If you're speaking in terms of overall cinematic experience, it's a wonderful film. I suggest that you read the book first, see the movie, and judge for yourself. Or if you've already seen the film, go r
